Defendants.
JOHN G. KOELTL, District Judge:
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell may refile her bill of costs by
June 2, 2021.
On March 22, 2021, judgment was entered dismissing the case
on the plaintiff's motion. ECF No. 103. On April 21, 2021, Ms.
Maxwell filed a bill of costs that was rejected by the Clerk for
failure to comply with technical filing requirements under the
Court's Local Rules. ECF No. 104. Ms. Maxwell refiled a bill
of costs on May 11, 2021, but this filing was untimely. ECF No.
105.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 (d) (1) provides that
"[u]nless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order
provides otherwise, costs-other than attorney's fees-should be
allowed to the prevailing party .. . The clerk may tax costs
on 14 days' notice." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 (d) (1). Local Civil
Rule 54.l(a) provides, in part, that "[w]ithin thirty (30) days
after the entry of final judgment, .. unless this period is

extended by the Court for good cause shown, any party seeking to
recover costs shall file with the Clerk a notice of taxation of
costs by Electronic Case Filing . . indicating the date and
time of taxation which shall comply with the notice period
prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 54, and annexing a bill of
costs. Any party failing to file a notice of taxation of
costs within the applicable thirty (30) day period will be
deemed to have waived costs.u
"The decision to award costs to a prevailing party under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) rests within the sound discretion of the
district court. The directive in Local Rule 54.1 does not
purport to interfere with that discretion.u Caravalho v. City of
New York, No. 13-cv-4174, 2018 WL 5312886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct.
26, 2018) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)
(allowing bill of costs to be filed one day late); see also V
Formation, Inc. v. Benetton Grp. SpA, No. 01-cv-610, 2003 WL
21403326, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2003) ("[F]inal judgment was
entered on March 18, 2003 and Salomon defendants moved for costs
on January 16, 2003 under the assumption that the stipulation of
discontinuance entered December 16, 2003 constituted a final
judgment. Although the bill of costs was filed prematurely, I
find good cause shown, given the confusion over whether the
stipulation constituted a final judgment, and no prejudice to
plaintiff to enlarge the time to submit a bill of costs.u).

Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 108 Filed 05/26/21 Page 3 of 3
In this case, good cause is shown because the plaintiff
originally timely filed the bill of costs, but the bill of costs
was rejected by the Clerk's office for failure to comply with
the Local Rules. There is no significant prejudice to the
plaintiff to allow for a brief extension to refile the bill of
costs in compliance with the Local Rules. Therefore, Ms.
Maxwell may refile the bill of costs by June 2, 2021. She should
consult with the Clerk's Office to assure that the form is
correct
SO ORDERED.
