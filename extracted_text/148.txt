UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO.: 08-CV-80119-MARRA.JOHNSON
JANE DOE NO. 2
Plaintiff,
V.
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
Defendant.
I
DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S UNOPPOSED FIRST MOTION TO AMEND
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO PLAINTIFF'S SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter "EPSTEIN"), by and through his
undersigned attorneys, moves to amend his affirmative defenses as set forth in the
attached Defendant EPSTEIN's First Amended Answer & Affirmative Defenses to
Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Rule 15(a),
Fed.R.Civ.P. (2009); Loe. Gen. Rules 7.1, 15.1 (S.D. Fla. 2009):
1. Pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., a party may amend his pleading "only
with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely
give leave when justice so requires." Plaintiff's counsel has consented in writing to
Defendant's proposed amendments set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Plaintiff's written
consent to the amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
2. It is well settled that leave to amend is liberally granted where, as here, there is
no resulting prejudice. The liberal allowance of pleading amendments is a "recognition
that controversies should be decided on the merits whenever practicable." See
generally, 27A Fed.Pree., Lawyers Ed. §62.273. Generally; freely allowed (2008). "In
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 148 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/09/2009 Page 2 of 4
the absence of any apparent or declared reason--such as undue delay, bad faith or
dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by
amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of
allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.--the leave sought should, as
the rules require, be 'freely given.'" Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9
L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).
3. In the instant case, Defendant only amended his affirmative defenses. This is
the first amendment sought by Defendant. Defendant's original Answer and Affirmative
Defenses to Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint was recently filed with this Court on
April 2, 2009. Recently certain constitutional issues have come to the forefront in other
litigation filed against EPSTEIN based on similar allegations regarding the 18 U.S.C.
§2255 claim and the punitive damages claim. Accordingly, Defendant seeks to add
affirmative defenses directed to those claims. See affirmative defenses in Exhibit A
hereto.
4. There will be no resulting prejudice to Plaintiff should leave to amend be granted.
Defendant has not unduly delayed this matter in seeking the amendments. Defendant
by written correspondence sought Plaintiff's permission to amend. As noted, Plaintiff
agreed in writing to the amendments. See Exhibit B hereto.
5. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to the amendments sought. Upon this Court
entering the order granting Defendant's motion to amend, he will file and serve the
Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint.
Loe. General Rule 15.1 (S.D. Fla. 2009).
