(collectively, the “Media Intervenors”) move to intervene in this action for the limited
purpose of asserting their right of access, pursuant to Section 905.27, Florida Statutes, to
any released grand jury materials involving Jeffrey Epstein, and state as follows:
FILED: PALM BEACH COUNTY, FL, JOSEPH ABRUZZO, CLERK, 06/24/2024 01:09:07 PM
1. The Media Intervenors are national, regional and local news and media
organizations that publish and broadcast information throughout the United States,
including Florida. Each of the Media Intervenors has reported on the controversies
surrounding Mr. Epstein and employ public and court records as important newsgathering
sources.
Y
2. The Plaintiff in this case, The Palm Beach Post, has soughPt to obtain grand
O
jury materials relating to Mr. Epstein. The controversy surrounding Mr. Epstein, the
C
criminal investigation into his alleged sex trafficking of minors, and the resulting plea
D
deal, are well known to the Court.
E
3. On February 29, 2024, the Court entered an order ruling that under the
I
F
current iteration of Section 905.27, Florida Statutes, releasing the grand jury materials
I
would not further the interests of justicTe. [DIN 184] Yet the court explained that, pursuant
R
to an amendment of Section 905.27 slated to take effect on July 1, 2024, the Court would
E
entertain a motion for reconsideration once the statute changes.
C
4. On June 12, 2024, The Palm Beach Post (“Post”) filed a Motion for
A
Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s February 29, 2024 Order. [DIN 208] The motion
T
explained that the amendments to Section 905.27 were intended to remove all prior
O
statutory hurdles to disclosure of the Epstein grand jury materials and that access to the
N
grand jury materials serves the public interest.
5. Like the Post, Media Intervenors fulfill the requirements of Section
905.27(2)(c), as amended. They are requesting disclosure of grand jury materials as
members of the media and, as explained in the Post’s motion, all statutory conditions for
release have been met: Mr. Epstein was the target of grand jury testimony relating to
2
criminal sexual activities between and adult and a minor, Mr. Epstein is deceased, the
Fourth District Court of Appeals ordered release of the grand jury materials for an in
camera review (which has been completed), and the current State Attorney was a party to
this litigation and ultimately adopted a neutral position concerning disclosure.
6. As such, Media Intervenors seek to intervene in this matter for the limited
Y
purpose of procuring access to any materials that, upon reconsideration, tPhe Court orders
O
to be disclosed.
C
7. The Media Intervenors possess standing to intervene in this matter, see
D
Miami Herald Publ’g Co. v. McIntosh, 340 So. 2d 904, 908 (Fla. 1976), for the purpose
E
of “imparting a more complete understanding to the public of the judicial system.” Miami
I
F
Herald Publishing Co. v. Lewis, 426 So.2d 1, 6 (Fla. 1983). See also WESH Television,
I
Inc. v. Freeman, 691 So. 2d 532, 535 (FTla. 5th DCA 1997) (media must be permitted to
R
intervene and be heard on motion seeking access to public records); News-Press Publ’g
E
Co. v. State, 345 so. 2d 865, 866 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977) (media permitted to intervene with
C
respect to order that had the “practical effect of making it more difficult for the press to
A
obtain information about the case which it may wish to publish”).1
T
8. The Media Intervenors communicated with counsel for both Plaintiff and
O
Defendant, neither of whom oppose the relief sought in this motion.
N
1 By an agreed order dated February 28, 2024, the Court permitted the Associated Press
to intervene in this action. [DIN 183] The Court similarly entered an agreed order on
March 5, 2024, granting the McClatchy Company, LLC’s motion to intervene. [DIN 187]
3
WHEREFORE, the Media Intervenors seek intervention in this case for the
limited purpose of obtaining access to the grand jury materials related to Mr. Epstein.
