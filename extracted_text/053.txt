------------------------------------------------------X
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, by and through her attorneys Haddon, Morgan &
Foreman, P.C., submits the following Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.
Introduction
A. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York on June
29, 2020 caused a meritless indictment to be issued against Ms. Maxwell.
B. Counsel for Ms. Maxwell has formed an opinion that responding to the allegations in
this Complaint “could provide a link in the chain of evidence necessary to prosecute” Ms.
Maxwell. See Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486-89 (1951); In re Gorsoan Ltd., 435
F.Supp.3d 589, 605-06 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).
C. Under these circumstances, on the advice of counsel, Ms. Maxwell will answer the
Complaint’s allegations to the extent that she can without waiving the right against self-
incrimination under the United States and New York constitutions and otherwise will invoke the
right.
