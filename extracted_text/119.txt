Re: Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Koeltl:
I write to withdraw Ms. Maxwell’s November 22, 2021 letter request for permission
to use the unredacted release in her defense in Case No. 20-cr-330-AJN. Due to
developments in the criminal proceeding, that request is now moot. I therefore also
request that this Court vacate the status conference presently set for 2:30 p.m. on
December 6, 2021.
Respectfully Submitted,
~ a .
