Re: Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Case Status Update – Global Settlement Reached
Dear Judge Koeltl:
Plaintiff Jane Doe has decided to accept the offer of compensation made to her by the
Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program ("Program"). Pursuant to Individual Rule II.B.,
plaintiff is requesting a pre-motion conference on her request to dismiss this action with
prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2). Since any acceptance of an offer made by the Program
requires that both defendants The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell be released in
the settlement agreement, plaintiff will be seeking a stipulation from these defendants to a
dismissal of this action with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) with each party to bear its
own fees and costs.
Respectfully submitted,
PANISH SHEA & BOYLE
