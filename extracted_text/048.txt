Re: Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as co-
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell, an individual,
1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Koeltl:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. We write to
further supplement the Co-Executors’ pending motion to dismiss (ECF Doc. 36) with the
enclosed Opinion & Orders entered in two other personal injury actions against the Co-
Executors. The first was entered earlier this month by The Hon. Edgardo Ramos in Lisa Doe v.
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Joint Personal Representatives of the Estate of
Jeffrey E. Epstein, et al. (19-cv-07773 (ER) (DCF)). The second was entered yesterday by The
Hon. Katherine Polk Failla in Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their
capacities as co-executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (19-cv-08673 (KPF) (DCF)). In
both Opinion & Orders, the sister courts grant the Co-Executors’ motions to dismiss the
plaintiffs’ punitive damages claim against them as a matter of law on grounds applicable to
Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages in this action.
Respectfully submitted,
s/Bennet J. Moskowitz
