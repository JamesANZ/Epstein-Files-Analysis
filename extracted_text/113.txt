AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL'S
APPLICATION FOR COSTS AGAINST PLAINTIFF
I, Laura A. Menninger, declare pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 and under penalty of perjury
that:
l. I am counsel for defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell in Doe v. Indyke. et al., No. 20-CV-
00484-JGK (S.D.N.Y.). I am personally familiar with the costs incurred in connection with the
litigation.
2. I am submitting this Declaration in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's Bill of Costs and
application for an award of costs against Jane Doe ("Plaintiff') in this action.
3. On January 15, 2021, Plaintifffiled a \'lotion to Dismiss with Prejudice Pursuant to
FRCP 4l(a)(2). Dkt. 91. Ms. Maxwell responded on January 29 (Dkt. 93), and further litigation
regarding the dismissal occurred over the succeeding months.
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 113 Filed 06/15/21 Page 18 of 24
4. On March 8, 202 l, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order which
determined, inter alia, that granted the dismissal with prejudice subject to certain conditions.
0kt. 98. Among the conditions were that Ms. Maxwell is permitted to seek her costs related to
this action from Plaintiff. Id. at 7. The parties accepted the Court's conditions and on March 19,
this Court issued an Order dismissing the case and ordering the conditions. Dkt. 102.
5. This Court determined that Ms. Maxwell is the "prevailing party for the purposes of
Rule 54(d). 0kt. 98 at 5. Accordingly she is entitled "under Rule 54(d), [to] 'costs-other than
attorney's fees." Id. (quoting Rule 54(d)).
6. Because discovery was stayed in the case by Magistrate Judge Freeman, the costs
were in fact de minimis. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell exercises her right to recovery of those
costs pursuant to Rule 54(d).
7. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1923, Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Docket Fees for
discontinuance of a civil action in the amount of $5.
8. Additionally, Ms. Maxwell incurred $8.70 in search and printing costs from PACER
associated with this case.
9. The total costs sought by Ms. Maxwell therefore is $13.70.
I 0. The Bill of Costs attached to the Notice and its exhibits evidence the costs incurred
by Ms. Maxwell in defense of this action.
11. Each of the costs claimed are allowed by law, specifically Local Civil Rule 54. l.
Each are correctly stated and were necessarily incurred.
I swear under penalty of pe~jury that the foregoing is true and accurate to the best of my
knowledge.

On March 19, 2021, this Court dismissed plaintiffs case with prejudice, based on her
motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41 (a)(2). As the prevailing party in
this matter, Ms. Maxwell hereby requests, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1 ), an order
awarding her taxable costs against plaintiff Jane Doe.
Rule 54( d)( I) provides that "[ u] nless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order
provides otherwise, costs-other than attorney's fees-should be allowed to the prevailing
party." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(I). ·'Courts consistently have found defendants to be prevailing
parties where the action against them was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice." Ctr.for
Discovery, Inc. v. D.P., No. 16-CV-3936-MKB-RER, 2018 WL 1583971, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Mar.
31, 2018); see Beer v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., 211 F.R.D. 67, 70 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) ("All
circuit courts to have directly addressed this issue have concluded that a defendant [who has
obtained a voluntary dismissal with prejudice] is a prevailing party, or alternatively, that a
district court has discretion to award costs to the defendant."); see also Carter v. Inc. Viii. of
Ocean Beach, 759 F.3d 159, 165 (2d Cir. 20 I 4) (disclaiming prior Second Circuit dicta which
stated that "generally the defendant is not considered the prevailing party when, as here, there is
a voluntary dismissal of the aetion by the plaintiff with prejudice." (citations omitted)). "A
voluntary dismissal of an action with prejudice [is considered to materially alter the relationship
of the pa1ties], because it constitutes ·an adjudication on the merits for purposes of res
judicata."' Carter, 759 F.3d at 165 (citation omitted); accord Feb. 12, 2021, Opinion and Order,
DE 118; accord Jane Doe v. Darren K. lndyke et. al, Case No. 20-cv-484 (JGK), DE 98 at 5
( addressing identical Rule 41 ( a)(2) motion and ho Id ing "Ms. Maxwell is correct that under
Second Circuit law, she is the prevailing party for the purposes of Rule 54(d)").
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 113 Filed 06/15/21 Page 22 of 24
An award of costs under Rule 54 is the "normal rule," and "the losing party has the
burden to show that costs should not be imposed." Torcivia v. Sujfolk Cty., 437 F. Supp. 3d 239,
249 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (quoting Harris v. Brown,No. 08-CV-1703 MKB, 2013 WL 632247, at *l
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2013). Once "the prevailing party demonstrates the amount of its costs and
that they fall within an allowable category of taxable costs, see Local Rule 54.1 (a), that party
enjoys a presumption that its costs will be awarded." Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v.
United Health Programs ofA m., Inc., 350 F. Supp. 3d 199,236 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting
Patterson v. McCarron, No. 99-cv-l I 078 (RCC), 2005 WL 735954, at* 1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30,
2005).
Annexed hereto is Ms. Maxwell's Bill of Costs, including the Affidavit of Laura
Menninger and exhibits, in the form required by Local Civil Rule 54.1 and including only those
taxable costs prescribed by the rule.1 As the prevailing party, Ms. Maxwell is presumptively
entitled to an award of cost, and plaintiff is unable to meet her burden to demonstrate why costs
should not be imposed. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court order plaintiff to pay
her costs in the amount detailed in the attached.
WHEREFORE, Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell requests an award of costs pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 54(d )( 1) as the prevailing party in this action.
1 Ms. Maxwell seeks herein only her costs and expressly reserves her right to seek
attorneys' fees incurred in defense of this action in future litigation either against plaintiff (e.g.,
as claims for malicious prosecution or abuse of process), against the Estate of Epstein (under an
indemnification theory), or both. See Opinion and Order of Feb. 10, 2021 at 5 (DE 118); accord
Opinion and Order of Mar. 9, 2021, Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke et. al, 20-cv-484 (JGK), at 5
(0kt. 98) (striking language from proposed Ruic 41 (a)(2) dismissal relating to each party paying
their own fees and costs to preserve right to seek attorneys' fees from this litigation in potential
future litigation for claims including the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution).

Re: Doe v. lmfyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Koeltl:
Plaintiff Jane Doe is in receipt of Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's Notice of Taxation of
Costs which is seeking $13.70 from Plaintiff. (ECF No. l 09). As this Court knows, after Ms.
Maxwell moved the Court to stay this case, the parties reached a global settlement agreement in
which one of the conditions was that Plaintiff had to dismiss this case with prejudice against the
Releasees to that agreement which included Ms. Maxwell and the Epstein Estate (which, of
course, is what typically happens after a case gets settled). In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff
disputes that Ms. Maxwell could be considered the prevailing party and entitled to
reimbursement of costs. Nonetheless. if the Court is inclined to grant Ms. Maxwell's request that
Plaintiff send her $13.70 that is what Plaintiff will do.
Respectfully submitted,
