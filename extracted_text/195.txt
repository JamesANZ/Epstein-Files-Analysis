Y
v.
P
DAVE ARONBERG, as State Attorney of
O
Palm Beach County, Florida; SHARON R.

MOTION OF DEFENDANT CA FLORIDA HOLDINGS, LLC FOR LEAVE TO
AMEND ITSI COMPLAINT
T
Defendant CA Florida Holdings, LLC, publisher of The Palm Beach Post, for its Motion
R
for Leave to Amend its ComplainEt pursuant to Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.190(a) alleges:
C
1. The Palm Beach Post (“PBP”) is a daily community newspaper with offices in West
Palm Beach, Florida. A
2. STince November 2019, PBP has sought to obtain an order allowing the release of
O
the 2006 Jeffrey Epstein grand jury transcripts.
N
3. PBP successfully obtained appellate reversal of a final judgment that held the courts
lack inherent authority to order release of grand jury transcripts. CA Fla. Holdings, LLC v.
Aronberg, 360 So. 3d 1149 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023).
4. As a result of PBP’s litigation, on February 29, 2024, Florida’s Governor signed
bill HB 117 that amended Fla. Stat. section 905.27. A copy of the amended section 905.27, which
is to take effect on July 1, 2024, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
*** FILED: PALM BEACH COUNTY, FL JOSEPH ABRUZZO, CLERK. 04/03/2024 12:30:07 PM ***
Ê
5. The amendments to section 905.27 were intended to remove any impediments to
release of the Jeffrey Epstein grand jury materials. By its terms, and as this Court acknowledged
in its February 29, 2024 Order, the amended statute provides a remedial process for PBP and the
public to obtain disclosure of the Epstein grand jury materials.
6. Due to the amendments to section 905.27, and the significant effect they have upon
Y
PBP’s current litigation, PBP requests that it be granted leave to file Pa Second Amended
O
Complaint. A copy of the proposed pleading is attached as Exhibit B.
C
7. If granted leave to amend, the pleadings will conform to the amendments to section
D
905.27.
E
8. Also, due to the dismissal of the State Attorney, the style of the case should be
I
F
amended to delete the State Attorney as a party. References to the current State Attorney in the
I
body of the proposed Second Amended CoTmplaint have been removed.
R
9. As the prior Clerk of the Court has retired, the style should be amended to substitute
E
the current Clerk, Joseph Abruzzo.
C
10. Because this Court authorized PBP in its February 29, 2024, Order to move for
A
reconsideration once the amendments to section 905.27 become effective on July 1, 2024, there is
T
no prejudice if leave to amend is granted. The Clerk has publicly stated his support for the section
O
905.27 amendments, and he has personally advocated for the release of the Epstein grand jury
N
materials. The intervenors have also stated that the Epstein grand jury materials should be
released.
WHEREFORE, PBP respectfully requests that this Court grant its motion for leave to
amend its complaint, permit PBP to file a Second Amended Complaint, and grant such other relief
the Court deems just and proper.

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
E
CA Florida Holdings, LLC, publisher of The IPalm Beach Post, for its Second Amended
F
Complaint against Joseph Abruzzo, the ClerkI of the Court and Comptroller for Palm Beach
T
County, Florida, in his official capacity (“Court Clerk”), alleges as follows:
R
EJURISDICTION
C
1. This is an action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court pursuant to
Fla. Stat. Sections 26.0A12(2)(a) and 86.011 et seq.
PARTIES
T
2. OThe Palm Beach Post is a daily community newspaper published by Plaintiff CA
N
Florida Holdings, LLC, with offices located at 2751 S. Dixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.
3. Defendant Joseph Abruzzo is the duly elected Clerk and Comptroller of Palm
Beach County, Florida. He is sued herein in his official capacity as his office is in possession
and/or control of documents that are the subject of this action.
ACTIVE 696232185v3
INTRODUCTION
4. In what is now widely if belatedly recognized as a colossal miscarriage of justice –
which led to the further needless victimization of countless young girls and women – a wealthy,
politically connected, and powerful financier was not held accountable for, nor even forced to
confront, allegations of serious sex trafficking crimes. While it is clear that Jeffrey Epstein’s 2008
Y
deal with the State of Florida was not consistent with the evidence gathered against him, what
P
O
remains shrouded in mystery is how that evidence was presented – and the extent to which it was
C
presented – to the grand jury that returned an indictment far more limited in scope than expected
D
and deserved.
E
5. Through this action, The Palm Beach Post seeks public access to the testimony,
I
F
minutes, and other evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm Beach County grand jury empaneled
I
during the first Epstein sex abuse investigaTtion. Typically, access to such materials is limited, for
R
example, in order to prevent the flight of those whose indictment may be contemplated and their
E
ability to conceal or destroy evidence; to ensure jurors’ candor in deliberations; and to protect an
C
accused who is later exonerated. However, these factors are inapplicable here. Also, Florida law
A
expressly authorizes the disclosure of grand jury proceedings under certain circumstances,
T
including, as here, in furthering justice, which can encompass furthering a public interest. Fla. Stat.
O
§ 905.27(1)(c).
N
6. It can no longer credibly be maintained that continued blanket secrecy over the
proceedings that led to the egregiously flawed 2006 Epstein indictment is warranted under the law.
To the contrary, transparency is required to promote public understanding of the criminal justice
system and public confidence in the fair administration of justice. As detailed below, Epstein was
accused of sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of women and girls in south Florida (among
other locations) over a period of several years while exploiting his wealth and political connections
2
ACTIVE 696232185v3
to obstruct the administration of justice at every turn. Public disclosure of the Epstein grand jury
proceedings will shed light on the extent to which those in our government entrusted with the
solemn responsibility of enforcing our criminal laws equally as to all citizens fulfilled their duties
in this instance. Justice will be furthered where it is either (1) demonstrated that Epstein was treated
like others accused of similar heinous crimes, or (2) as appears more likely to be the case, those
Y
who chose to give Epstein favorable – “unusual,” in the words of the Town oPf Palm Beach Police
O
Chief – treatment, are exposed and held accountable. From what limited information is now in the
C
public domain, the State Attorney’s referral of Epstein’s case to the grand jury – which would be
D
out of the ordinary for this type of case – gives rise to a strong inference of favoritism and
E
corresponding disregard for the rights of the minor victims of Epstein’s sex trafficking. Access to
I
F
the grand jury materials will allow the public to determine whether the grand jury process, and the
I
secrecy that comes with it, was used to furTther justice or, instead, operated to shield Epstein and
R
his co-conspirators from the consequences of their criminal activities. Accordingly, Fla. Stat.
E
Section 905.27 authorizes the disclosure of Epstein’s 2006 grand jury proceedings.
C
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A
7. The following facts were gathered, in large part, from documents obtained by The
T
Palm Beach Post through various Florida Public Records Law requests, documents unsealed or
O
publicly available in other related judicial proceedings, and information and documents in the
N
public record.
A. First Epstein Sex Crimes Investigation, Indictment, and Plea Agreement:
2005—2008.
8. The investigation into Epstein’s sex crimes began more than fourteen years ago,
when a 14-year-old girl’s stepmother reported to police in the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, that
Epstein and others who worked for him arranged for her to give Epstein a “massage.” Epstein
3
ACTIVE 696232185v3
required the girl to strip, exposed himself, and masturbated while touching her. The girl was paid
$300. Epstein was 52 years old at the time.
9. Following this initial report in 2005, the Town of Palm Beach Police, and later, in
2006, the FBI, investigated Epstein. Interviews under oath with five additional alleged victims and
seventeen witnesses revealed that the events described by the 14-year-old girl occurred, with
Y
disturbingly similar details, with each of the other victims. P
O
10. Both the victim/witness interviews, as well as evidence retrieved following a search
C
of Epstein’s home, showed that some of the girls involved were under the age of 18. The police
D
search of Epstein’s residence also found two hidden cameras and, throughout the house, large
E
numbers of nude photos of girls, including victims whom the police had not interviewed in the
I
F
course of their investigation.
I
11. In March 2006, a State granTd jury was scheduled at which all of the victims were
R
expected to testify. The proceeding was postponed, however, due to meetings between the State
E
Attorney’s office and Epstein’s prominent criminal defense lawyer and personal friend, Alan
C
Dershowitz.
A
12. Another grand jury was convened in April 2006, but canceled the day before it was
T
to begin receiving evidence.
O
(1) Police Chief Reiter’s Letter to the State Attorney.
N
13. On May 1, 2006, Town of Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote a
“personal and confidential” letter to then Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer,
stating:
I must renew my prior observation to you that I continue to find your office’s
treatment of [the Epstein] cases highly unusual. It is regrettable that I am forced to
communicate in this manner, but my most recent telephone calls to you and those
of the lead detective to your assigned attorneys have been unanswered and
messages remain unreturned. After giving this much thought and consideration, I
4
ACTIVE 696232185v3
must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office’s handling of this
matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your
disqualification from the prosecution of these cases. (Emphasis supplied)
14. Chief Reiter’s letter to State Attorney Krischer enclosed the Town of Palm Beach
Police Department’s probable cause affidavits charging Epstein and two of his assistants with
multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor and one count of sexual abuse, and requested
Y
that either an arrest warrant be issued for Epstein or the State Attorney directly initiate the charges
P
O
against him, which would be public.
C
(2) The July 2006 State Grand Jury Presentation.
15. Instead, State Attorney Krischer elected to reDfer the case to a grand jury, which is
E
mandatory for capital cases but rarely used for all other crimes. According to an official
I
spokesperson, this was the first time that a sex criFmes case was presented to a grand jury in Palm
I
Beach County. T
R
16. In July 2006, after State Attorney Krischer presented testimony and evidence from
E
one victim, the grand jury returned an indictment on a sole count of solicitation of prostitution.
C
There is no mention in the indictment of the victim being a minor.
A
17. On information and belief, a second of Epstein’s victims was supposed to testify
T
before the grand jury, but was unable to attend because of a school exam.
O
18. No reasonable explanation has been provided as to why the numerous other known
N
victims were not presented as witnesses and crime victims to the grand jury convened in July 2006.
Nor has any reasonable explanation been provided as to why State Attorney Krischer, who was
initially eager to investigate and prosecute Epstein for his crimes, over time lost the desire to do
so.
19. On information and belief, during the grand jury appearance of the single victim
who testified, the State Attorney presented evidence that vilified the victim and attacked her
5
ACTIVE 696232185v3
credibility, including soliciting testimony regarding underage drinking and questionable personal
behavior that was unrelated to the charges against Epstein. Further upon information and belief,
this information was initially brought to the attention of the State Attorney’s office by Epstein’s
defense counsel.
(3) The FBI’s Investigation and Epstein’s Non-Prosecution
Y
Agreement With Federal Authorities.
P
20. On information and belief, following the deficient July 2006 indictment, and with
O
Chief Reiter’s encouragement, the FBI began its own investigation of Epstein.
C
21. Records unsealed in 2015 revealed that the FBI com piled reports on “34 confirmed
D
minors” that were victims of Epstein’s sexual predations. Based on evidence gathered by the FBI,
E
a 53-page indictment was prepared by the U.S. AttorIney’s Office in June 2007. However, at the
F
request of Epstein’s lawyers, the indictment waIs never presented to a federal grand jury.
T
22. Instead, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta,
R
negotiated a plea deal with EpsteEin’s team of lawyers to grant immunity to Epstein (along with
C
four named co-conspirators and any unnamed potential co-conspirators) from all federal criminal
charges. A
23. T
T
hroughout the remainder of 2007 and through the first half of 2008, Epstein’s
O
lawyers and the U.S. Attorney continued negotiating the plea arrangement. Upon information and
N
belief, Epstein’s lawyers insisted that (1) the victims not be notified, (2) the deal be kept
confidential and under seal, and (3) all grand jury subpoenas (including one that had already been
issued for Epstein’s computers) be withdrawn.
24. On June 30, 2008, Epstein pled guilty to State charges: one count of solicitation of
prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was
6
ACTIVE 696232185v3
sentenced to 18 months in jail, followed by a year of community control or house arrest, and was
adjudicated as a convicted sex offender required to register twice a year in Florida.
25. The plea deal, called a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”), allowed Epstein to
receive immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life.
On information and belief, based on public records, former State Attorney Krischer communicated
Y
with then U.S. Attorney Acosta concerning the NPA’s negotiation with EpstePin’s lawyers.
O
26. Indeed, Epstein was not incarcerated in a Florida prison for the State crimes for
C
which he was convicted. Instead, he was placed in a private wing of the Palm Beach County
D
Stockade, where, after 3 1⁄2 months, he was allowed to leave the jail on “work release” for up to
E
12 hours a day, 6 days a week. His private driver provided his transportation to and from “work.”
I
F
27. Epstein was released five months early.
I
28. Upon information and belieTf, Epstein violated the terms of his probation, but was
R
not prosecuted.
E
(4) The Crime Victims’ Rights Act Litigation.
C
29. Epstein’s vic tims only learned after the fact about his plea in State court and filed
A
an emergency petition to force federal prosecutors to comply with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act
T
(18 U.S.C. § 3771, “CVRA”), which mandates certain rights for crime victims, including the right
O
to be informed about plea agreements and the right to appear at sentencing. U.S. District Judge
N
Kenneth A. Marra recently ruled that federal prosecutors violated the CVRA by failing to notify
Epstein’s victims before allowing him to plead guilty to only the two State offenses.
30. The prosecution’s failure to keep the victims apprised, among other things, also
contravenes the Florida Constitution, Article 1, § 16(b) and Fla. Stat. § 960.001.
31. Following publicity exposing the extraordinary leniency of the plea deal, dozens of
civil suits were brought against Epstein, most of which Epstein’s lawyers settled out-of-court.
7
ACTIVE 696232185v3
32. In 2010, Epstein was registered as a “level three” (i.e., high risk of repeat offense)
sex offender in New York, a lifelong designation. In 2011, the New York County District
Attorney’s office unsuccessfully sought to lower his registration to low-risk “level one.”
33. Upon information and belief, during the course of the Town of Palm Beach and FBI
investigations, Epstein retained private investigators to follow, harass, and photograph his victims
Y
and their families, as well as Chief Reiter and the Town of Palm Beach detectPive who investigated
O
the case against Epstein.
C
34. Upon information and belief, Epstein’s victims were threatened against cooperating
D
with law enforcement and told that they would be compensated only if they did not cooperate with
E
law enforcement.

I
35. On July 6, 2019, Epstein waTs arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.
R
36. Upon information and belief, the United States government’s investigation of new
E
allegations and charges stemmed, in part, from continued press investigations into and reporting
C
on the mishandling of the 2006 charges and the civil suits that followed.
A
37. In a July 8, 2019, letter to the federal district court by the U.S. Attorney for the
T
Southern District of New York, Epstein was described as “a serial sexual predator who preyed on
O
dozens of minor girls over a period of years.” The letter emphasized that “the Government has real
N
concerns – grounded in past experience with this defendant – that if allowed to remain out on bail,
the defendant could attempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this
case, including victims and their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice.” It also
described the results of the FBI’s search of Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse: evidence of sex
trafficking in the form of “hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs
of fully- or partially-nude females,” including underage females. In a locked safe, compact discs
8
ACTIVE 696232185v3
were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc
nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude.”
38. On July 8, 2019, prosecutors with the Public Corruption Unit of the U.S. Attorney’s
office for the Southern District of New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy
to traffic minors for sex. The grand jury indictment alleges that “dozens” of underage girls were
Y
brought into Epstein’s mansions for sexual encounters. A few days later, owPing to public outcry
O
over the NPA with Epstein entered into by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida,
C
Alexander Acosta, who by then was serving as U.S. Secretary of Labor in the Trump
D
administration, resigned from office.
E
39. Epstein was denied bail and was placed into pretrial detention at the federal
I
F
Metropolitan Correction Center in lower Manhattan.
I
40. On or about August 6, 2019T, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered a state criminal
R
probe into the actions of the Palm Beach Sheriff and former State Attorney Krischer for their
E
handling of the Epstein underage sex trafficking case.
C
41. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan
A
Correctional Center. His cause of death was determined to be suicide.
T
C. The August 27, 2019, SDNY Hearing: Epstein’s Victims Speak.
O
42. On account of his death, prosecutors sought to dismiss the indictment against
N
Epstein, while maintaining that they would continue to investigate his co-conspirators.
43. United States Senior District Judge Richard M. Berman ordered a hearing on
August 27, 2019, on the prosecutors’ decision to dismiss the indictment and allowed victims to
speak at the hearing.
9
ACTIVE 696232185v3
44. In the course of the hearing, more than two dozen victims delivered their personal
stories of pain, frustration, and sexual abuse at the hands of Epstein. Several victims spoke of
violent rape by Epstein. Many more victims were present in the courtroom but did not testify.
45. While some questioned the reasoning behind the court’s decision to give the victims
voice after Epstein’s death, District Judge Berman noted that “a public hearing is [the] preferred
Y
vehicle of resolution,” emphasizing that “public hearings are exactly what Pjudges do. Hearings
O
promote transparency and they provide the court with insights and information which the court
C
may not otherwise be aware of.” Indeed, even Epstein’s defense lawyer noted at the hearing that
D
the court “is the institution that most people have confidence in, in these very troubled times.”
E
46. At the August 27th hearing, the girls, now women, spoke about their “exploitation
I
F
and coercion,” and to the fact that many of them “were in very vulnerable situations and in extreme
I
poverty, circumstances where [they] didnT ’t have anyone on [their] side, to speak on [their]
R
behalf….” One victim lamented that “as a victim, [she] never got to see what the agreement was
E
or why the special treatment got approved” in the Florida case years earlier. Another noted how
C
“completely different” the investigators leading to the 2019 federal indictment were from the
A
prosecutors in the Florida case, both in their treatment of her and their investigation of her
T
victimization by Epstein.
O
47. A former federal judge in attendance at the August 27th hearing emphasized that
N
“transparency is one of the overriding objectives in our criminal justice system.”
48. Nearly all of the victims expressed the conviction that the secrecy that shielded
Epstein has caused them “irreparable harm” and that an opportunity to address his criminal
wrongdoings, and those of the individuals who enabled his sexual racketeering, would allow for
at least some measure of justice to be served after his death. Indeed, one victim stated: “Any efforts
10
ACTIVE 696232185v3
made to protect Epstein’s name and legacy send a message to the victims that he wins and that he
is untouchable.” Another victim expressed fear that this is a world “where there are predators in
power, a world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep enough.” In short, the
“unusual” treatment Epstein received in Florida in 2006 based on his wealth, social status, and
connections severely eroded the public’s faith in the integrity and impartiality of the criminal
Y
justice system. P
O
D. The Palm Beach Post’s Standing and the Public Interest.
C
(1) The Palm Beach Post Has Reported Extensively On
Epstein’s Crimes For Nearly 15 Ye ars.
D
49. Plaintiff, The Palm Beach Post, is a community newspaper serving readers in Palm
E
Beach County and the Treasure Coast vicinity. I
F
50. The Palm Beach Post has been a Pulitzer Prize winner and nominated as a finalist
I
T
three other times.
R
51. Beginning in 2004, The Palm Beach Post has extensively investigated and reported
E
C
on the allegations against, the law enforcement investigation of, and the crimes committed by,
Epstein and his co-coAnspirators. The Newspaper’s reportage has included publication of the
following articles:
T
 O“The Man Who Had Everything: Jeffrey Epstein Craved Big Homes, Elite Friends
and, Investigators Say, Underage Girls.,” published on August 14, 2006, reporting that:
N
Haley Robson, a local community college student, admitted in a sworn statement to
police that “she had taken at least six girls to visit Epstein, all between the ages of 14
and 16;” Palm Beach Police “interviewed five alleged victims and 17 witnesses;”
“Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, traveled to West Palm Beach with information
about the girls,” including social media discussions about “their use of alcohol and
marijuana;” after meeting with Epstein’s legal team, “prosecutors postponed their
decision to take the case to a grand jury;” Palm Beach Police subsequently “received
complaints that two of the victims or their families had been harassed or threatened;”
“relations between police and prosecutors were fraying” as the investigation continued;
and “one girl who was subpoenaed – the one who said she had sexual intercourse with
Epstein – never showed up” to testify before the grand jury.

“Billionaire money manager and Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey Epstein
solicited or procured prostitutes three or more times between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 of last
year, according to an indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution.”
Y
The article further reported that “Epstein’s case is unusual in that suspected prostitution
johns are usually charged with a misdemeanor, and even a felony charge is typically
P
made in a criminal information – an alternative to an indictment charging a person with
O
the commission of a crime.”
C
 “After Long Probe, Billionaire Faces Solicitation Charge” published on July 26, 2006,
reporting that “Palm Beach police thought there was p robable cause to charge Epstein
D
with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation.” The article
further reported that “Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry with State Attorney
E
Barry Krischer’s handling of the case that he wrote a memo suggesting the county’s
top prosecutor disqualify himself,” and idIentified a 20-year-old on-the-record female
source who said “she gave Epstein a mFassage in the nude, then brought him six girls,
ages 14 to 16, for massage and sex-tIinged sessions at his home.”
T
 “Police Say Lawyer Tried to Discredit Teenage Girls” published on July 29, 2006,
R
reporting that “[f]amed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz met with the Palm
Beach County State Attorney’s Office and provided damaging information about
E
teenage girls who say they gave his client, Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein,
C
sexually charged massages” and that “[t]he state attorney’s office said it presented the
Epstein case to a county grand jury this month rather than directly charging Epstein
because of Aconcerns about the girls’ credibility.”
 “Expert: Ignorance of Age Isn’t Defense In Sex Cases” published on August 5, 2006,
T
reporting that “[r]ather than file charges, the state attorney’s office presented the case
Oto a county grand jury” which “indicted Epstein last week on a single, less serious
charge of felony solicitation of prostitution,” and that “[t]he case raised eyebrows
Nbecause the state attorney’s office rarely, if ever, kicks such charges to a grand jury.”
 “Epstein Camp Calls Female Accusers Liars” published on August 8, 2006, reporting
that “[a] state attorney’s spokesman would say only that the office refers cases to the
grand jury when there are issues with the viability of the evidence or witnesses’
credibility.”
 “Palm Beach Chief Focus of Fire In Epstein Case” published on August 14, 2006,
reporting that Chief Reiter “pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious
crimes of sexual activity with minors” and “slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in

what he perceived as that office’s mishandling of the case.”

P
55, pleaded guilty . . . to felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under
O
the age of 18 for prostitution,” resulting in “a lifelong obligation to register as a sex
offender,” and that “[a]s part of the plea deal, federal investigators agreed to drop their
C
investigation of Epstein, which they had taken to a grand jury.”
 “Jeffrey Epstein: Scientist, Stuntman, ‘Sex SlavDe’ Visit Jailed Tycoon” published on
August 13, 2008, reporting that “[d]uring his first month of confinement” Epstein was

N
 “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Feds Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms” published on

pleaded guilty to prostitution-related felonies in state court” and “also agreed not to
charge any of Epstein’s possible co-conspirators: Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley
Groff and Nadia Marcinkova.” The article further reported that, according to an
attorney representing three of Epstein’s victims, “none of the 30 to 40 wom[e]n
identified as victims in the federal investigation” were informed ahead of time about
the NPA.

C
A true and correct copy of the above news articles, in either the computerized format in which they
A
are maintained in The Palm Beach Post’s electronic archives or the news print edition in which
T
originally published, is annexed hereto as Exhibit 1.
O
52. Since the filing of the initial Complaint in this matter, The Palm Beach Post – along
N
with media worldwide – has continued to report on Epstein’s crimes and the ongoing official
proceedings resulting from those crimes.
(2) The Palm Beach Post’s Standing and the Public Interest.
53. The press has a constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings, see, e.g.,
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 573 (1980), including pre-trial criminal
proceedings. Newman v. Graddick, 696 F.2d 796 (11th Cir. 1983). Indeed, “the integrity of the
14
ACTIVE 696232185v3
judicial process, which public scrutiny is supposed to safeguard, is just as much at issue in
proceedings of this kind [pre- and post-trial] as at trial.” Id. at 801; see also Miami Herald Publ.
Co. v. Lewis, 426 So. 2d 1, 6–7 (Fla. 1982) (identifying the news media as a “public surrogate” in
matters concerning the closure of judicial proceedings). The press also has a First Amendment
interest in receiving information from willing speakers. See Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer
Y
Council, 425 U.S. 748, 756–57 (1976) (“Where a speaker exists . . . the proPtection afforded [by
O
the First Amendment] is to the communication, to its source and to its recipients both.”); Pittman
C
v. Cole, 267 F.3d 1269, 1283 n.12 (11th Cir. 2001) (“The Supreme Court has recognized that the
D
First Amendment offers protection to both speakers and those wishing to receive speech.”); see
E
also Stephens v. Cty. of Albemarle, Va., 524 F.3d 485, 492 (4th Cir. 2008) (providing that a plaintiff
I
F
has “standing to assert a right to receive speech” by “show[ing] that there exists a speaker willing
I
to convey the information to her”).
T
R
54. Because of the unique role performed by the press as a “public surrogate” (Lewis,
E
426 So. 2d at 6–7) in protecting the right of access and its interest in reporting information about
C
criminal proceedings, news organizations “presumptively have a right to access judicial records,”
A
Comm’r, Ala. Dep’t of Corr. v. Advance Local Media, LLC, 918 F.3d 1161, 1166 (11th Cir. 2019),
T
and “standing to question the validity of an order restricting publicity because its ability to gather
O
news is directly impaired or curtailed.” Lewis, 426 So. 2d at 4; see also Carlson v. United States,
N
837 F.3d 753, 757–58 (7th Cir. 2016) (“[a]s a member of the public, [the Reporters Committee]
has standing to assert [its] claim” to grand jury materials because such materials are “public records
to which the public may seek access, even if that effort is ultimately unsuccessful”).
55. Here, the continued denial of access to information The Palm Beach Post seeks on
behalf of its journalists and the public it serves “unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”
15
ACTIVE 696232185v3
Gainesville Woman Care, LLC v. State of Florida, 210 So. 3d 1243, 1263 (Fla. 2017); see also
Zerilli v. Smith, 656 F.2d 705, 711 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting that “the press’ function as a vital
source of information is weakened whenever the ability of journalists to gather information is
impaired,” as it is by Attorney General’s refusal to disclose unredacted report and underlying grand
jury materials).
Y
56. The Palm Beach Post has the right to maintain this private rigPht of action because
O
the furtherance of justice, an express legislative exception to grand jury secrecy, is intended for
C
the public benefit, and The Palm Beach Post seeks access on behalf of the public. Fla. Stat.
D
§ 905.27(1)(c). It is further expressed in Fla. Stat. § 905.27 that the legislature in amending Fla.
E
Stat. § 905.27(1)(c) and (2)(c) in 2024, intended for this to disclose the Jeffrey Epstein grand jury
I
F
materials. In other words, the legislature cleared all arguments against release of the Jeffrey Epstein
I
grand jury materials. T
R
(3) The Court’s Jurisdiction To Declare Rights And
ConsEtrue Statutes.
C
57. This Court has jurisdiction to declare rights, status, and other equitable or legal
relations whether or noAt further relief is or could be claimed. Florida Stat. Section 86.011.
58. Florida law specifically provides that a declaration may be sought from the Court
T
O
concerning a petitioner’s rights under a statute. Florida Stat. Section 86.021 (“Any person…whose
N
rights, status, or other equitable or legal relations are affected by a statute, or any regulation made
under statutory authority,…may have determined any question of construction or validity arising
under such statute,…or any part thereof, and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other equitable
or legal relations thereunder.”).
59. The Court’s exercise of its power to declare rights “is to be liberally administered
and construed.” Florida Stat. Section 86.101.
16
ACTIVE 696232185v3
COUNT I
(Declaratory Relief - Florida Stat. Sections 86.011 et seq.)
60. The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 59 are incorporated by reference
as if fully set forth herein.
61. This is an action for Declaratory Relief pursuant to Chapter 86, Florida Statutes,
Y
and other supplemental relief. P
O
62. The Palm Beach Post respectfully requests that the Court declare pursuant to Fla.
C
Stat. Sections 905.27(1) and (2)(c) that it is entitled access to the testimony, minutes, and other
D
evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm Beach County grand jury because such disclosure and
E
access would be furthering justice in the public interest. Fla. Stat. § 905.27(1)(c).
I
F
63. The Palm Beach Post has sought access to the testimony, minutes, and other
I
evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm BeTach County grand jury. A good-faith dispute exists.
R
64. Through this Complaint, The Palm Beach Post presently has a justiciable question
E
concerning its rights to obtain the 2006 grand jury materials pursuant to Fla. Stat. Sections
C
905.27(1) (c) and (2)(c).
A
65. In an appeal from the final judgment entered on December 21, 2022 in this case,
T
the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s decision that Florida courts lack
O
authority to order the release of grand jury materials. Rejecting the trial court’s determination, the
N
appellate court held that trial courts have inherent authority over grand juries and have the right to
order release of grand jury materials if such would further justice as defined in Fla. Stat. section
905.27. CA Fla. Holdings, LLC v. Aronberg, 360 So. 3d 1149 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023). Therefore, this
court has inherent authority to release the Epstein grand jury materials in addition to the statutory
authority granted by the 2024 amendments to Fla. Stat. section 905.27.
17
ACTIVE 696232185v3
66. A bona fide, actual, present, and practical need for the declaration exists in order to
further justice in the public interest by the release of the 2006 Epstein grand jury materials.
WHEREFORE, The Palm Beach Post respectfully requests that the Court determine the
rights and obligations of the parties by declaring that pursuant to Fla. Stat. Sections 905.27(1)(c)
and (2)(c). The Palm Beach Post and the public may gain access to the testimony.
Y
COUNT II P
O
(Florida Stat. Section 905.27)
C
67. The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 66 are incorporated by reference
D
as if fully set forth herein.
E
68. Based on information learned by The Palm Beach Post through its Florida Public
I
F
Records Law requests, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the grand jury evidence
I
and proceedings, judicial documents obtainTed from independent but related court proceedings, and
R
documents otherwise available in the public record, the 2006 State Attorney for Palm Beach
E
County, Barry Krischer, presented truncated evidence of Epstein’s criminal wrongdoing to the
C
2006 grand jury in a man ner that precluded Epstein’s indictment for the serious crimes he
A
committed, including sex trafficking and sexual assault.
T
69. Pursuant to Florida Stat. Section 905.27, as amended in 2024, in order to further
O
justice for Epstein’s victims and the public, and to provide public disclosure to illuminate whether
N
Epstein received unjustifiably lenient treatment based on the available evidence, The Palm Beach
Post requests that it and the public be granted immediate access to the testimony, minutes, and
other evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm Beach County grand jury.
70. In 2024, the Florida legislature amended Fla. Stat. Sections 905.27 (1)(c) and (2)(c)
for the express purpose of removing all legal impediments to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein
