Re: Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Koeltl:
I write pursuant to this Court's order of dismissal, dated March 19, 2021, granting
plaintiffs motion for dismissal with prejudice on the condition that she provide to
Ms. Maxwell an authentic, unredacted, and signed copy of the General Release she
executed with the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP). Dkt. No. 102.
This Court explained that production of the Release was subject to the Order on
Plaintiffs' Anonymity and that Ms. Maxwell could not disclose the Release except
pursuant to an order of this Court.
Ms. Maxwell now seeks authorization from this Court to disclose the Release as part
of her criminal defense.
As this Court knows, Ms. Maxwell is facing a multi-count indictment in Case No. 20-
cr-330-AJN, which is scheduled to go to trial beginning on November 29, 2021.
As explained in the briefing on plaintiffs motion to dismiss this case, and as this
Court recognized in granting that motion subject to the condition that plaintiff provide
Ms. Maxwell with the Release, Ms. Maxwell's constitutional rights to present a
defense and to confrontation require that she be able to use the Release in her defense
of the criminal case. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. The Release is material to her
defense, and it shows plaintiffs bias and motive in alleging that Ms. Maxwell was
involved in alleged abuse.
A criminal defendant "states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that
[ s ]he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination
designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby

'to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors could appropriately draw inferences
relating to the reliability of the witness."' Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673
(1986) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308,318, (1974)). "[T]he exposure ofa
witness' motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the
constitutionally protected right of cross-examination."' Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S.
227, 231 (1988) (quoting Davis, 415 U.S. at 316-17).
At the time this Court ordered plaintiff to disclose the Release, it was unclear whether
the government had a copy of the Release as well, such that it would be produced to
Ms. Maxwell as Brady material. See Moore v. Marr, 254 F.3d 1235, 1244 (10th Cir.
2001) (witness's "application for victim compensation payments and application for
and receipt of emergency victim compensation payments may well have been
'favorable' within the meaning of Brady," requiring government disclosure of
exculpatory evidence to criminal defendants). It is now clear the government does not
have a copy of the Release, and as the government is keen to remind Ms. Maxwell at
every turn, it "is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have." United
States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 727, 746 (E.D.N.Y. 1994). Although Ms. Maxwell has
issued a Rule 17( c) subpoena to the EVCP for the Release (as well as other
materials), Judge Nathan has not yet ruled on several motions to quash that subpoena,
including one filed by plaintiff.
In order to vindicate her constitutional rights to present a defense and to
confrontation, Ms. Maxwell seeks leave from this Court to use the Release disclosed
by plaintiff in the defense of the criminal case pending before Judge Nathan.
Respectfully Submitted,
a.
