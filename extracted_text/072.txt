Re: Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as
executors of the Estate of Jefferey E. Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell,
No. 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Co-Executors of the
Estate of Jefferey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. We write
solely to correct the record with regard to a misstatement in the letter filed by counsel for Plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) this afternoon. Plaintiff’s counsel, in a footnote, represented that they had
“attached the full and complete email string concerning this issue for the Court's review and
consideration.” Doc. 71 n.1. However, Plaintiff’s counsel omitted our reply sent today, before
they filed their letter. The full chain is attached hereto.
Respectfully submitted,
s/ Mary Grace W. Metcalfe
