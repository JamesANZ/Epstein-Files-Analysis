incrimination], because affirmative defenses do not constitute the kind of voluntary
application for affirmative relief" which would prevent a plaintiff bringing a claim seeking
affirmative relief from asserting the privilege.
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief sought by Plaintiff.
Affirmative Defenses
1. As to all counts, Plaintiff actually consented to and was a willing participant in the
acts alleged, and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be
reduced accordingly.
2. As to all counts alleged, Plaintiff actually consented to and participated in
conduct similar and/or identical to the acts alleged with other persons which were the
sole or contributing cause of Plaintiff's alleged damages.
3. As to all counts, Plaintiff impliedly consented to the acts alleged by not objecting,
and therefore, her claims are barred, or her damages are required to be reduced
accordingly.
4. As to all counts, Defendant reasonably believed or was told that the Plaintiff had
attained the age of 18 years old at the time of the alleged acts.
5. As to all counts, Plaintiff's claims are barred as she said she was 18 years or
older at the time.
6. As to all counts, Plaintiff's alleged damages were caused in whole or part by
events and/or circumstances completely unrelated to the incident(s) alleged in the
complaint.
7. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

Jane Doe No. 2 v. Epstein
Page 7
8. As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault &
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," such claims are
subject to the limitations as set forth in §768.72, et seq., Florida Statutes.
9. As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault &
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," such claims are
subject to the constitutional limitations and guideposts as set forth in BMW of North
America v. Gore, 116 S.Ct 1589 (1996); Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 127 S.Ct. 1057
(2007); State Farm v. Campbell, 123 S.Ct 1513 (2003); Engle v. Ligget Group. Inc., 945
So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
United States Constitution and Florida's Constitution, Art. I, §§2 and 9, prohibit the
imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments
10 .As to Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages in Count I - "Sexual Assault &
Battery," and Count II - "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," the determination of
whether or not Defendant is liable for punitive damages is required to be bifurcated from
a determination of the amount to be imposed.
11. Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for sexual assault and/or battery
under Count I.
12.As to Count 111, Plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action as she does not and
can not show a violation of a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. §2255 (2005).
13.As to Count Ill, the version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 in effect at the time of the alleged
conduct applies, and, thus, the presumptive minimum damages amount should Plaintiff
prove the elements of such claim is $50,000, and not subject to any multiplier.

14.As to Count Ill, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, effective
July 27, 2006, would be in violation of the legal axiom against retroactive application of
an amended statute, and also in violation of such constitutional principles, including but
not limited to, the "Ex Post Facto" Clause, U.S. Const. Article I, §9, cl. 3, §10, cl. 1, and
th th
procedural and substantive due process, U.S. Const. 14 Amend., 5 Amend. The
statute in effect during the time of the alleged conduct applies.
15.As to Count 111, application of the amended version of 18 U.S.C. §2255, effective
July 27, 2006, is prohibited pursuant to the vagueness doctrine and the Rule of Lenity.
A criminal statute is required to give " 'fair warning ... in language that the common
world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make
the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.' " United States v. Lanier,
520 U.S. 259,265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting McBoyle v. United
States. 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931)) (omission in original). The
"three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement" are: (1) the vagueness
doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an
act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its
meaning and differ as to its application; (2) the canon of strict construction of criminal
statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal
statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered; (3) due process bars courts from
applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor
any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope.

16. The applicable version of 18 U.S.C. §2255 creates a cause of action on behalf of
a "minor." Plaintiff had attained the age of majority at the time of filing this action, and
accordingly, her cause of action is barred.
17. Because Plaintiff has no claim under 18 U.S.C. §2255, this Court is without
subject matter jurisdiction as to all claims asserted.
18.Application of the 18 U.S.C. §2255, as amended, effective July 27, 2006, is in
violation of the constitutional principles of due process, the "Ex Post Facto" clause, and
the Rule of Lenity, in that in amending the term "minor" to "person" as to those who may
bring a cause of action impermissibly and unconstitutionally broadened the scope of
persons able to bring a §2255 claim.
19. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment
under the U.S. Constitution, and thus Plaintiff's claim thereunder is barred.
20. 18 U.S.C. §2255 violates the constitutional guarantees of procedural and
substantive due process. Procedural due process guarantees that a person will not be
deprived of life, liberty or property without notice and opportunity to be heard.
Substantive due process protects fundamental rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff's cause of
action thereunder is barred.
WHEREFORE Defendant requests that this Court deny the relief ught by Plaintiff.
