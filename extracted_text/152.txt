DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NOS. 101 AND 102'S
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE UNDER SEAL RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO STAY OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO UNSEAL THE
NONPROSECUTION AGREEMENT {dated 5/29/09, [DE 128)
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned
attorneys responds to the Plaintiffs' Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 ("Plaintiffs")
Motion For Leave To File Under Seal Response In Opposition To Defendant's Motion To Stay
Or, In The Alternative, To Unseal The Nonprosecution Agreement, and states:
1. This Court has already entered orders preserving the confidentiality of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement ("NP A") and denying prior attempts to have the document unsealed. See
Court's Orders, attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively, entered in In Re: Jane
Does 1 and 2, Petitioners, Case No. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON, A. Order To Compel
Production And Protective Order, [DE 26], dated August 21, 2008, and B. Order [DE 36], dated
February 12, 2009, on Petitioners' Motion To Unseal Non-Prosecution Agreement [DE 28].
Both of these Orders are clear that the terms of the NP A are to remain confidential and remain
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 152 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 4 of 8
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page4
protected from being disclosed to third parties. The NP A is an agreement between the United
States Attorney's Office and EPSTEIN. Plaintiffs' motion presents nothing in support of this
Court modifying its prior orders.
2. Significantly, even the United States Attorney's Office (USAO), along with
Defendant, has strongly opposed making the NP A public. Attached as Exhibit C hereto is
Respondent United States of America's Opposition To Victims' Motion To Unseal Non
Prosecution Agreement, dated October 8, 2008, [DE 29], also filed in In Re: Jane Does 1 and 2,
Petitioners, Case No. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON. In opposing the petitioners' attempts
to make public the terms of the NP A, the United States in the Response, Exhibit C, stated:
Since the Agreement (NP A) has not been filed under seal with this Court, the
legal authority cited by petitoners regarding sealing of documents, United States v.
Ochoa-Vasque, 428 F.3d 1015 (11th Cir. 2005), is inapposite. The parties who
negotiated the Agreement, the United States Attorney's Office and Jeffrey Epstein,
determined the Agreement should remain confidential. They were free to do so, and
violated no law in making such an agreement. Since the Agreement has become
relevant to the instant lawsuit, petitioners have been given access to it, upon the
condition that it not be disclosed further. Petitioners have no legal right to disclose
the Agreement to third parties, or standing to challenge the confidentiality provision.
After the United States' response, Exhibit C, this Court entered its Order, Exhibit B,
agreeing with the United States' position and maintaining the confidentiality of the NP A in
accordance with its prior Order, Exhibit A. The "victims" who were provided a copy of the
NPA were and are required to maintain the NP A's confidentiality and not disclose the terms to
third parties.
3. Other parties in the consolidated cases have been able to file their responses
without a similar request being made. Defendant believes that these Plaintiffs can fully respond
without the need to file under seal; and reference provisions generally. However if the Court is
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 152 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 5 of 8
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page 5
inclined to grant this Order, then in order to continue to protect the confidentiality of the NP A
and to comply with the Court's prior Orders, Exhibit A and Exhibit B, Defendant would agree
to allow Plaintiff to file under seal her response and reference only those portions (identified
herein) of the NP A which are potentially relevant to the issues arising under claims brought
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2255 and thus, that may have impact on Defendant's motion for stay and
Plaintiffs response thereto. Specifically, the only portions relevant for this Court to make a
decision on Defendant's motion and Plaintiffs' response are paragraphs 7, 8, 9, andl0 of the
NPA, and paragraphs 7A, 7B, and 7C of the Addendum To The NPA.
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an Order denying any attempts
by Plaintiffs to unseal or make public or to disclose to third parties the terms of the NP A, and to
deny Plaintiffs move to file their response under seal; or if the Court is inclined to grant the
motion, to allow Plaintiff to file her response to the motion to stay and only the specified
portions of the NP A and Addendum thereto under seal.
