Re: Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Koeltl:
Plaintiff Jane Doe is in receipt of Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's Notice of Taxation of
Costs which is seeking $13.70 from Plaintiff. (ECF No. 109). As this Court knows, after Ms.
Maxwell moved the Court to stay this case, the parties reached a global settlement agreement in
which one of the conditions was that Plaintiff had to dismiss this case with prejudice against the
Releasees to that agreement which included Ms. Maxwell and the Epstein Estate (which, of
course, is what typically happens after a case gets settled). In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff
disputes that Ms. Maxwell could be considered the prevailing party and entitled to
reimbursement of costs. Nonetheless, if the Court is inclined to grant Ms. Maxwell's request that
Plaintiff send her $13.70 that is what Plaintiff will do.
Respectfully submitted,
PANISH SHEA & BOYLE
