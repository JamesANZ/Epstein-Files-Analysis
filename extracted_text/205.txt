ACTIVE 696232185v3
FILED: PALM BEACH COUNTY, FL, JOSEPH ABRUZZO, CLERK, 05/17/2024 11:40:36 AM
INTRODUCTION
4. In what is now widely if belatedly recognized as a colossal miscarriage of justice –
which led to the further needless victimization of countless young girls and women – a wealthy,
politically connected, and powerful financier was not held accountable for, nor even forced to
confront, allegations of serious sex trafficking crimes. While it is clear that Jeffrey Epstein’s 2008
Y
deal with the State of Florida was not consistent with the evidence gathered against him, what
P
O
remains shrouded in mystery is how that evidence was presented – and the extent to which it was
C
presented – to the grand jury that returned an indictment far more limited in scope than expected
D
and deserved.
E
5. Through this action, The Palm Beach Post seeks public access to the testimony,
I
F
minutes, and other evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm Beach County grand jury empaneled
I
during the first Epstein sex abuse investigaTtion. Typically, access to such materials is limited, for
R
example, in order to prevent the flight of those whose indictment may be contemplated and their
E
ability to conceal or destroy evidence; to ensure jurors’ candor in deliberations; and to protect an
C
accused who is later exonerated. However, these factors are inapplicable here. Also, Florida law
A
expressly authorizes the disclosure of grand jury proceedings under certain circumstances,
T
including, as here, in furthering justice, which can encompass furthering a public interest. Fla. Stat.
O
§ 905.27(1)(c).
N
6. It can no longer credibly be maintained that continued blanket secrecy over the
proceedings that led to the egregiously flawed 2006 Epstein indictment is warranted under the law.
To the contrary, transparency is required to promote public understanding of the criminal justice
system and public confidence in the fair administration of justice. As detailed below, Epstein was
accused of sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of women and girls in south Florida (among
other locations) over a period of several years while exploiting his wealth and political connections
2
ACTIVE 696232185v3
to obstruct the administration of justice at every turn. Public disclosure of the Epstein grand jury
proceedings will shed light on the extent to which those in our government entrusted with the
solemn responsibility of enforcing our criminal laws equally as to all citizens fulfilled their duties
in this instance. Justice will be furthered where it is either (1) demonstrated that Epstein was treated
like others accused of similar heinous crimes, or (2) as appears more likely to be the case, those
Y
who chose to give Epstein favorable – “unusual,” in the words of the Town oPf Palm Beach Police
O
Chief – treatment, are exposed and held accountable. From what limited information is now in the
C
public domain, the State Attorney’s referral of Epstein’s case to the grand jury – which would be
D
out of the ordinary for this type of case – gives rise to a strong inference of favoritism and
E
corresponding disregard for the rights of the minor victims of Epstein’s sex trafficking. Access to
I
F
the grand jury materials will allow the public to determine whether the grand jury process, and the
I
secrecy that comes with it, was used to furTther justice or, instead, operated to shield Epstein and
R
his co-conspirators from the consequences of their criminal activities. Accordingly, Fla. Stat.
E
Section 905.27 authorizes the disclosure of Epstein’s 2006 grand jury proceedings.
C
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A
7. The following facts were gathered, in large part, from documents obtained by The
T
Palm Beach Post through various Florida Public Records Law requests, documents unsealed or
O
publicly available in other related judicial proceedings, and information and documents in the
N
public record.
A. First Epstein Sex Crimes Investigation, Indictment, and Plea Agreement:
2005—2008.
8. The investigation into Epstein’s sex crimes began more than fourteen years ago,
when a 14-year-old girl’s stepmother reported to police in the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, that
Epstein and others who worked for him arranged for her to give Epstein a “massage.” Epstein
3
ACTIVE 696232185v3
required the girl to strip, exposed himself, and masturbated while touching her. The girl was paid
$300. Epstein was 52 years old at the time.
9. Following this initial report in 2005, the Town of Palm Beach Police, and later, in
2006, the FBI, investigated Epstein. Interviews under oath with five additional alleged victims and
seventeen witnesses revealed that the events described by the 14-year-old girl occurred, with
Y
disturbingly similar details, with each of the other victims. P
O
10. Both the victim/witness interviews, as well as evidence retrieved following a search
C
of Epstein’s home, showed that some of the girls involved were under the age of 18. The police
D
search of Epstein’s residence also found two hidden cameras and, throughout the house, large
E
numbers of nude photos of girls, including victims whom the police had not interviewed in the
I
F
course of their investigation.
I
11. In March 2006, a State granTd jury was scheduled at which all of the victims were
R
expected to testify. The proceeding was postponed, however, due to meetings between the State
E
Attorney’s office and Epstein’s prominent criminal defense lawyer and personal friend, Alan
C
Dershowitz.
A
12. Another grand jury was convened in April 2006, but canceled the day before it was
T
to begin receiving evidence.
O
(1) Police Chief Reiter’s Letter to the State Attorney.
N
13. On May 1, 2006, Town of Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote a
“personal and confidential” letter to then Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer,
stating:
I must renew my prior observation to you that I continue to find your office’s
treatment of [the Epstein] cases highly unusual. It is regrettable that I am forced to
communicate in this manner, but my most recent telephone calls to you and those
of the lead detective to your assigned attorneys have been unanswered and
messages remain unreturned. After giving this much thought and consideration, I
4
ACTIVE 696232185v3
must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office’s handling of this
matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your
disqualification from the prosecution of these cases. (Emphasis supplied)
14. Chief Reiter’s letter to State Attorney Krischer enclosed the Town of Palm Beach
Police Department’s probable cause affidavits charging Epstein and two of his assistants with
multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor and one count of sexual abuse, and requested
Y
that either an arrest warrant be issued for Epstein or the State Attorney directly initiate the charges
P
O
against him, which would be public.
C
(2) The July 2006 State Grand Jury Presentation.
15. Instead, State Attorney Krischer elected to reDfer the case to a grand jury, which is
E
mandatory for capital cases but rarely used for all other crimes. According to an official
I
spokesperson, this was the first time that a sex criFmes case was presented to a grand jury in Palm
I
Beach County. T
R
16. In July 2006, after State Attorney Krischer presented testimony and evidence from
E
one victim, the grand jury returned an indictment on a sole count of solicitation of prostitution.
C
There is no mention in the indictment of the victim being a minor.
A
17. On information and belief, a second of Epstein’s victims was supposed to testify
T
before the grand jury, but was unable to attend because of a school exam.
O
18. No reasonable explanation has been provided as to why the numerous other known
N
victims were not presented as witnesses and crime victims to the grand jury convened in July 2006.
Nor has any reasonable explanation been provided as to why State Attorney Krischer, who was
initially eager to investigate and prosecute Epstein for his crimes, over time lost the desire to do
so.
19. On information and belief, during the grand jury appearance of the single victim
who testified, the State Attorney presented evidence that vilified the victim and attacked her
5
ACTIVE 696232185v3
credibility, including soliciting testimony regarding underage drinking and questionable personal
behavior that was unrelated to the charges against Epstein. Further upon information and belief,
this information was initially brought to the attention of the State Attorney’s office by Epstein’s
defense counsel.
(3) The FBI’s Investigation and Epstein’s Non-Prosecution
Y
Agreement With Federal Authorities.
P
20. On information and belief, following the deficient July 2006 indictment, and with
O
Chief Reiter’s encouragement, the FBI began its own investigation of Epstein.
C
21. Records unsealed in 2015 revealed that the FBI com piled reports on “34 confirmed
D
minors” that were victims of Epstein’s sexual predations. Based on evidence gathered by the FBI,
E
a 53-page indictment was prepared by the U.S. AttorIney’s Office in June 2007. However, at the
F
request of Epstein’s lawyers, the indictment waIs never presented to a federal grand jury.
T
22. Instead, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta,
R
negotiated a plea deal with EpsteEin’s team of lawyers to grant immunity to Epstein (along with
C
four named co-conspirators and any unnamed potential co-conspirators) from all federal criminal
charges. A
23. T
T
hrou ghout the remainder of 2007 and through the first half of 2008, Epstein’s
O
lawyers and the U.S. Attorney continued negotiating the plea arrangement. Upon information and
N
belief, Epstein’s lawyers insisted that (1) the victims not be notified, (2) the deal be kept
confidential and under seal, and (3) all grand jury subpoenas (including one that had already been
issued for Epstein’s computers) be withdrawn.
24. On June 30, 2008, Epstein pled guilty to State charges: one count of solicitation of
prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. He was
6
ACTIVE 696232185v3
sentenced to 18 months in jail, followed by a year of community control or house arrest, and was
adjudicated as a convicted sex offender required to register twice a year in Florida.
25. The plea deal, called a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”), allowed Epstein to
receive immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life.
On information and belief, based on public records, former State Attorney Krischer communicated
Y
with then U.S. Attorney Acosta concerning the NPA’s negotiation with EpstePin’s lawyers.
O
26. Indeed, Epstein was not incarcerated in a Florida prison for the State crimes for
C
which he was convicted. Instead, he was placed in a private wing of the Palm Beach County
D
Stockade, where, after 3 1⁄2 months, he was allowed to leave the jail on “work release” for up to
E
12 hours a day, 6 days a week. His private driver provided his transportation to and from “work.”
I
27. Epstein was released five months e
F
arly.
I
28. Upon information and belieTf, Epstein violated the terms of his probation, but was
R
not prosecuted.
E
(4) The Crime Victims’ Rights Act Litigation.
C
29. Epstein’s vic tims only learned after the fact about his plea in State court and filed
A
an emergency petition to force federal prosecutors to comply with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act
T
(18 U.S.C. § 3771, “CVRA”), which mandates certain rights for crime victims, including the right
O
to be informed about plea agreements and the right to appear at sentencing. U.S. District Judge
N
Kenneth A. Marra recently ruled that federal prosecutors violated the CVRA by failing to notify
Epstein’s victims before allowing him to plead guilty to only the two State offenses.
30. The prosecution’s failure to keep the victims apprised, among other things, also
contravenes the Florida Constitution, Article 1, § 16(b) and Fla. Stat. § 960.001.
31. Following publicity exposing the extraordinary leniency of the plea deal, dozens of
civil suits were brought against Epstein, most of which Epstein’s lawyers settled out-of-court.
7
ACTIVE 696232185v3
32. In 2010, Epstein was registered as a “level three” (i.e., high risk of repeat offense)
sex offender in New York, a lifelong designation. In 2011, the New York County District
Attorney’s office unsuccessfully sought to lower his registration to low-risk “level one.”
33. Upon information and belief, during the course of the Town of Palm Beach and FBI
investigations, Epstein retained private investigators to follow, harass, and photograph his victims
Y
and their families, as well as Chief Reiter and the Town of Palm Beach detectPive who investigated
O
the case against Epstein.
C
34. Upon information and belief, Epstein’s victims were threatened against cooperating
D
with law enforcement and told that they would be compensated only if they did not cooperate with
E
law enforcement.
I
B. Second Epstein Sex Crimes Investig
F
ation, Indictment, Suicide: 2019.
I
35. On July 6, 2019, Epstein waTs arrested on federal sex trafficking charges.
R
36. Upon information and belief, the United States government’s investigation of new
E
allegations and charges stemmed, in part, from continued press investigations into and reporting
C
on the mishandling of the 2006 charges and the civil suits that followed.
A
37. In a July 8, 2019, letter to the federal district court by the U.S. Attorney for the
T
Southern District of New York, Epstein was described as “a serial sexual predator who preyed on
O
dozens of minor girls over a period of years.” The letter emphasized that “the Government has real
N
concerns – grounded in past experience with this defendant – that if allowed to remain out on bail,
the defendant could attempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this
case, including victims and their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice.” It also
described the results of the FBI’s search of Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse: evidence of sex
trafficking in the form of “hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs
of fully- or partially-nude females,” including underage females. In a locked safe, compact discs
8
ACTIVE 696232185v3
were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc
nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude.”
38. On July 8, 2019, prosecutors with the Public Corruption Unit of the U.S. Attorney’s
office for the Southern District of New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy
to traffic minors for sex. The grand jury indictment alleges that “dozens” of underage girls were
Y
brought into Epstein’s mansions for sexual encounters. A few days later, owPing to public outcry
O
over the NPA with Epstein entered into by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida,
C
Alexander Acosta, who by then was serving as U.S. Secretary of Labor in the Trump
D
administration, resigned from office.
E
39. Epstein was denied bail and was placed into pretrial detention at the federal
I
F
Metropolitan Correction Center in lower Manhattan.
I
40. On or about August 6, 2019T, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered a state criminal
R
probe into the actions of the Palm Beach Sheriff and former State Attorney Krischer for their
E
handling of the Epstein underage sex trafficking case.
C
41. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan
A
Correctional Center. His cause of death was determined to be suicide.
T
C. The August 27, 2019, SDNY Hearing: Epstein’s Victims Speak.
O
42. On account of his death, prosecutors sought to dismiss the indictment against
N
Epstein, while maintaining that they would continue to investigate his co-conspirators.
43. United States Senior District Judge Richard M. Berman ordered a hearing on
August 27, 2019, on the prosecutors’ decision to dismiss the indictment and allowed victims to
speak at the hearing.
9
ACTIVE 696232185v3
44. In the course of the hearing, more than two dozen victims delivered their personal
stories of pain, frustration, and sexual abuse at the hands of Epstein. Several victims spoke of
violent rape by Epstein. Many more victims were present in the courtroom but did not testify.
45. While some questioned the reasoning behind the court’s decision to give the victims
voice after Epstein’s death, District Judge Berman noted that “a public hearing is [the] preferred
Y
vehicle of resolution,” emphasizing that “public hearings are exactly what Pjudges do. Hearings
O
promote transparency and they provide the court with insights and information which the court
C
may not otherwise be aware of.” Indeed, even Epstein’s defense lawyer noted at the hearing that
D
the court “is the institution that most people have confidence in, in these very troubled times.”
E
46. At the August 27th hearing, the girls, now women, spoke about their “exploitation
I
F
and coercion,” and to the fact that many of them “were in very vulnerable situations and in extreme
I
poverty, circumstances where [they] didnT ’t have anyone on [their] side, to speak on [their]
R
behalf….” One victim lamented that “as a victim, [she] never got to see what the agreement was
E
or why the special treatment got approved” in the Florida case years earlier. Another noted how
C
“completely different” the investigators leading to the 2019 federal indictment were from the
A
prosecutors in the Florida case, both in their treatment of her and their investigation of her
T
victimization by Epstein.
O
47. A former federal judge in attendance at the August 27th hearing emphasized that
N
“transparency is one of the overriding objectives in our criminal justice system.”
48. Nearly all of the victims expressed the conviction that the secrecy that shielded
Epstein has caused them “irreparable harm” and that an opportunity to address his criminal
wrongdoings, and those of the individuals who enabled his sexual racketeering, would allow for
at least some measure of justice to be served after his death. Indeed, one victim stated: “Any efforts
10
ACTIVE 696232185v3
made to protect Epstein’s name and legacy send a message to the victims that he wins and that he
is untouchable.” Another victim expressed fear that this is a world “where there are predators in
power, a world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep enough.” In short, the
“unusual” treatment Epstein received in Florida in 2006 based on his wealth, social status, and
connections severely eroded the public’s faith in the integrity and impartiality of the criminal
Y
justice system. P
O
D. The Palm Beach Post’s Standing and the Public Interest.
C
(1) The Palm Beach Post Has Reported Extensively On
Epstein’s Crimes For Nearly 15 Ye ars.
D
49. Plaintiff, The Palm Beach Post, is a community newspaper serving readers in Palm
E
Beach County and the Treasure Coast vicinity. I
F
50. The Palm Beach Post has been a Pulitzer Prize winner and nominated as a finalist

R
51. Beginning in 2004, The Palm Beach Post has extensively investigated and reported
E
C
on the allegations against, the law enforcement investigation of, and the crimes committed by,
Epstein and his co-coAnspirators. The Newspaper’s reportage has included publication of the
following articles:

N
Haley Robson, a local community college student, admitted in a sworn statement to
police that “she had taken at least six girls to visit Epstein, all between the ages of 14
and 16;” Palm Beach Police “interviewed five alleged victims and 17 witnesses;”
“Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, traveled to West Palm Beach with information
about the girls,” including social media discussions about “their use of alcohol and
marijuana;” after meeting with Epstein’s legal team, “prosecutors postponed their
decision to take the case to a grand jury;” Palm Beach Police subsequently “received
complaints that two of the victims or their families had been harassed or threatened;”
“relations between police and prosecutors were fraying” as the investigation continued;
and “one girl who was subpoenaed – the one who said she had sexual intercourse with
Epstein – never showed up” to testify before the grand jury.

(2) The Palm Beach Post’s Standing and the Public Interest.
53. The press has a constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings, see, e.g.,
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 573 (1980), including pre-trial criminal
proceedings. Newman v. Graddick, 696 F.2d 796 (11th Cir. 1983). Indeed, “the integrity of the
14
ACTIVE 696232185v3
judicial process, which public scrutiny is supposed to safeguard, is just as much at issue in
proceedings of this kind [pre- and post-trial] as at trial.” Id. at 801; see also Miami Herald Publ.
Co. v. Lewis, 426 So. 2d 1, 6–7 (Fla. 1982) (identifying the news media as a “public surrogate” in
matters concerning the closure of judicial proceedings). The press also has a First Amendment
interest in receiving information from willing speakers. See Va. Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Consumer
Y
Council, 425 U.S. 748, 756–57 (1976) (“Where a speaker exists . . . the proPtection afforded [by
O
the First Amendment] is to the communication, to its source and to its recipients both.”); Pittman
C
v. Cole, 267 F.3d 1269, 1283 n.12 (11th Cir. 2001) (“The Supreme Court has recognized that the
D
First Amendment offers protection to both speakers and those wishing to receive speech.”); see
E
also Stephens v. Cty. of Albemarle, Va., 524 F.3d 485, 492 (4th Cir. 2008) (providing that a plaintiff
I
F
has “standing to assert a right to receive speech” by “show[ing] that there exists a speaker willing
I
to convey the information to her”).
T
R
54. Because of the unique role performed by the press as a “public surrogate” (Lewis,
E
426 So. 2d at 6–7) in protecting the right of access and its interest in reporting information about
C
criminal proceedings, news organizations “presumptively have a right to access judicial records,”
A
Comm’r, Ala. Dep’t of Corr. v. Advance Local Media, LLC, 918 F.3d 1161, 1166 (11th Cir. 2019),
T
and “standing to question the validity of an order restricting publicity because its ability to gather
O
news is directly impaired or curtailed.” Lewis, 426 So. 2d at 4; see also Carlson v. United States,
N
837 F.3d 753, 757–58 (7th Cir. 2016) (“[a]s a member of the public, [the Reporters Committee]
has standing to assert [its] claim” to grand jury materials because such materials are “public records
to which the public may seek access, even if that effort is ultimately unsuccessful”).
55. Here, the continued denial of access to information The Palm Beach Post seeks on
behalf of its journalists and the public it serves “unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”
15
ACTIVE 696232185v3
Gainesville Woman Care, LLC v. State of Florida, 210 So. 3d 1243, 1263 (Fla. 2017); see also
Zerilli v. Smith, 656 F.2d 705, 711 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (noting that “the press’ function as a vital
source of information is weakened whenever the ability of journalists to gather information is
impaired,” as it is by Attorney General’s refusal to disclose unredacted report and underlying grand
jury materials).
Y
56. The Palm Beach Post has the right to maintain this private rigPht of action because
O
the furtherance of justice, an express legislative exception to grand jury secrecy, is intended for
C
the public benefit, and The Palm Beach Post seeks access on behalf of the public. Fla. Stat.
D
§ 905.27(1)(c). It is further expressed in Fla. Stat. § 905.27 that the legislature in amending Fla.
E
Stat. § 905.27(1)(c) and (2)(c) in 2024, intended for this to disclose the Jeffrey Epstein grand jury
I
F
materials. In other words, the legislature cleared all arguments against release of the Jeffrey Epstein
I
grand jury materials. T
R
(3) The Court’s Jurisdiction To Declare Rights And
ConsEtrue Statutes.
C
57. This Court has jurisdiction to declare rights, status, and other equitable or legal
relations whether or noAt further relief is or could be claimed. Florida Stat. Section 86.011.
58. Florid a law specifically provides that a declaration may be sought from the Court
T
O
concerning a petitioner’s rights under a statute. Florida Stat. Section 86.021 (“Any person…whose
N
rights, status, or other equitable or legal relations are affected by a statute, or any regulation made
under statutory authority,…may have determined any question of construction or validity arising
under such statute,…or any part thereof, and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other equitable
or legal relations thereunder.”).
59. The Court’s exercise of its power to declare rights “is to be liberally administered
and construed.” Florida Stat. Section 86.101.
16
ACTIVE 696232185v3
COUNT I
(Declaratory Relief - Florida Stat. Sections 86.011 et seq.)
60. The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 59 are incorporated by reference
as if fully set forth herein.
61. This is an action for Declaratory Relief pursuant to Chapter 86, Florida Statutes,
Y
and other supplemental relief. P
O
62. The Palm Beach Post respectfully requests that the Court declare pursuant to Fla.
C
Stat. Sections 905.27(1) and (2)(c) that it is entitled access to the testimony, minutes, and other
D
evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm Beach County grand jury because such disclosure and
E
access would be furthering justice in the public interest. Fla. Stat. § 905.27(1)(c).
I
63. The Palm Beach Post has sough
F
t access to the testimony, minutes, and other
I
evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm BeTach County grand jury. A good-faith dispute exists.
R
64. Through this Complaint, The Palm Beach Post presently has a justiciable question
E
concerning its rights to obtain the 2006 grand jury materials pursuant to Fla. Stat. Sections
C
905.27(1) (c) and (2)(c).
A
65. In an appeal from the final judgment entered on December 21, 2022 in this case,
T
the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s decision that Florida courts lack
O
authority to order the release of grand jury materials. Rejecting the trial court’s determination, the
N
appellate court held that trial courts have inherent authority over grand juries and have the right to
order release of grand jury materials if such would further justice as defined in Fla. Stat. section
905.27. CA Fla. Holdings, LLC v. Aronberg, 360 So. 3d 1149 (Fla. 4th DCA 2023). Therefore, this
court has inherent authority to release the Epstein grand jury materials in addition to the statutory
authority granted by the 2024 amendments to Fla. Stat. section 905.27.
17
ACTIVE 696232185v3
66. A bona fide, actual, present, and practical need for the declaration exists in order to
further justice in the public interest by the release of the 2006 Epstein grand jury materials.
WHEREFORE, The Palm Beach Post respectfully requests that the Court determine the
rights and obligations of the parties by declaring that pursuant to Fla. Stat. Sections 905.27(1)(c)
and (2)(c). The Palm Beach Post and the public may gain access to the testimony.
Y
COUNT II P
O
(Florida Stat. Section 905.27)
C
67. The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 66 are incorporated by reference
D
as if fully set forth herein.
E
68. Based on information learned by The Palm Beach Post through its Florida Public
I
F
Records Law requests, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the grand jury evidence
I
and proceedings, judicial documents obtainTed from independent but related court proceedings, and
R
documents otherwise available in the public record, the 2006 State Attorney for Palm Beach
E
County, Barry Krischer, presented truncated evidence of Epstein’s criminal wrongdoing to the
C
2006 grand jury in a man ner that precluded Epstein’s indictment for the serious crimes he
A
committed, including sex trafficking and sexual assault.
T
69. Pursuant to Florida Stat. Section 905.27, as amended in 2024, in order to further
O
justice for Epstein’s victims and the public, and to provide public disclosure to illuminate whether
N
Epstein received unjustifiably lenient treatment based on the available evidence, The Palm Beach
Post requests that it and the public be granted immediate access to the testimony, minutes, and
other evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm Beach County grand jury.
70. In 2024, the Florida legislature amended Fla. Stat. Sections 905.27 (1)(c) and (2)(c)
for the express purpose of removing all legal impediments to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein
18
ACTIVE 696232185v3
grand jury materials. Therefore, other than for limited redactions to protect witness and victim
identities, Fla. Stat. Sections 905.27 (1)(c) and (2)(c) compel disclosure of the Epstein 2006 grand
jury materials.
WHEREFORE, The Palm Beach Post respectfully requests that this Court, pursuant to Fla.
Stat. Sections 905.27(1)(c) and (2)(c), as amended, order the Clerk of the Court to provide copies
Y
of the testimony, minutes, and other evidence presented in 2006 to the Palm PBeach County grand

REAL NEWS STARTS HERE
The Man Who Had Everything: Jeffrey Epstein craved big
homes, elite friends and underage girls
Y
By Andrew ~~E~~
Posted Jul 17, 2019 at 6:02 AM
P
From the archives: When Palm Beach detectives started asking
O
questions and teenage girls started talking, a wave of legal resistance
C
followed.
D
Editor's Note: This article appeared in The Palm Beach PostE on August 14, 2006, three weeks after
I
Jeffrey Epstein's arrest in Palm Beach County on a charge off elony solicitation of prostitution.
F
I
WINGED GARGOYLES guarded the gateT at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach mansion. Inside,
hidden cameras trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went.
R
E
For the police detectives who sifted through the garbage outside and kept records of visitors, it
C
was the lair of a troubling target.
A
Epstein, one of the most mysterious of the country's mega-rich, was known as much for his
secrecy as for his love of fine things: magnificent homes, private jets, beautiful women,
T
friendships with the world's elite.
O
But at PNalm Beach police headquarters, he was becoming known for something else: the
regular arrival of teenage girls he hired to give him massages and, police say, perform sexual
favors.
Epstein was different from most sexual abuse suspects; he was far more powerful. He counted
among his friends former President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew, along
with some of the most prominent legal, scientific and business minds in the country.
When detectives started asking questions and teenage girls started talking, a wave of legal
resistance followed.
>> NEW: Jeffrey Epstein: Lawyer said financier had sex with woman during work
release
If Palm Beach police didn't know quite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they found out soon enough.
Epstein, now 53, was a quintessential man of mystery. He amassed his fortune and friends
quietly, always in the background as he navigated New York high society.
Y
When he first attracted notice in the early 1990s, it was on account of the woman he was
P
dating: Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell.
O
In a lengthy article, headlined "The Mystery of Ghislaine MaxweCll's Secret Love," the British
Mail on Sunday tabloid laid out speculative stories that the socialite's beau was a CIA spook, a
D
math teacher, a concert pianist or a corporate headhunter.
E
"But what is the truth about him?" the newspaper wondered. "Like Maxwell, Epstein is both
I
flamboyant and intensely private." F
I
T
The media frenzy did not begin in full until a decade later. In September 2002, Epstein was
R
flung into the limelight when he flew Clinton and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker to
Africa on his private jet. E
C
Suddenly everyone wanted to know who Epstein was. New York magazine and Vanity Fair
published lengthy profAiles. The New York Post listed him as one of the city's most eligible
bachelors and began describing him in its gossip columns with adjectives such as "mysterious"
T
and "reclusive."
O
Although Epstein gave no interviews, the broad strokes of his past started to come into focus.
N
Building a life of extravagance
He was born blue-collar in 1953, the son of a New York City parks department employee, and
raised in Brooklyn's Coney Island neighborhood. He left college without a bachelor's degree
but became a math teacher at the prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan.
The story goes that the father of one of Epstein's students was so impressed with the man that
he put him in touch with a senior partner at Bear Stearns, the global investment bank and
securities firm.
In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a job at Bear Stearns. By the early 1980s, he had started].
Epstein and Co. That is when he began making his millions in earnest.
Little is known or said about Epstein's business except this: He manages money for the
extremely wealthy. He is said to handle accounts only of $1 billion or greater.
It has been estimated he has roughly 15 clients, but their identities are the subject of only
speculation. All except for one: Leslie Wexner, founder of The Limited retail chain and a
Y
former Palm Beacher who is said to have been a mentor to Epstein.
P
O
W exner sold Epstein one of his most lavish residences: a massive townhouse that dominates a
block on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It is reported to have, amoCng its finer features, closed
circuit television and a heated sidewalk to melt away fallen snow .
D
That townhouse, thought to be the largest private resiEdence in Manhattan, is only a piece of
the extravagant world Epstein built over time.
I
F
In New Mexico, he constructed a 27,000-squaIre-foot hilltop mansion on a 10,000-acre ranch
T
outside Santa Fe. Many believed it to be the largest home in the state.
R
In Palm Beach, he bought a waterEfront home on El Brillo Way. And he owns a 100-acre
private island in the Virgin Islands.
C
>> PHOTOS: The playAers in the Jeffrey Epstein saga
Perhaps as remarkTable as his lavish homes is his extensive network of friends and associates at
the highest eOchelons of power. This includes not only socialites but also business tycoons,
media moguls, politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-winning scientists whose research he often
N
funds.
'Just like other people collect art, he collects scientists," said Martin Nowak, who directs the
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University and was reportedly the recipient of
a $30 million research donation from Epstein.
Epstein is said to have befriended former Harvard President Larry Summers, prominent law
Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald Trump and New York Daily News Publisher Mort
Zuckerman.
And yet he managed for decades to maintain a low profile. He avoids eating out and was rarely
photographed.
'The odd thing is I never met him," said Dominick Dunne, the famous chronicler of the trials
and tribulations of the very rich. "I wasn't even aware of him," except for a Vanity Fair article.
Epstein's friendship with Clinton has attracted the most attention.
Y
Epstein met Clinton as early as 1995, when he paid tens of thousands of dollars to join him at
an intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm Beach. But from all appearances, tPhey did not become
O
close friends until after Clinton left the Oval Office and moved to New York.
C
Epstein has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates' campaigns, including John
Kerry's presidential bid, the reelection campaign of New MDexico Gov. Bill Richardson and the
Senate bids ofJ oe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles
E
Schumer.
I
F
Powerful friends and enemies I
T
A Vanity Fair profile found cracks in tRhe veneer of Epstein's life story. The 2003 article said he
left Bear Stearns in the wake of a fEederal probe and a possible Securities and Exchange
Commission violation. It alsoC pointed out that Citibank once sued him for defaulting on a $20
million loan.
A
The article suggested that one of his business mentors and previous employers was Steven
T
Hoffenberg, now serving a prison term after "bilking investors out of more than $450 million
O
in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history."
N
As he amassed his wealth, Epstein made enemies in disputes both large and small. He sued the
man who in 1990 sold him his multimillion-dollar Palm Beach home over a dispute about less
than $16,000 in furnishings.
A former friend claimed Epstein backed out of a promise to reimburse him hundreds of
thousands of dollars after their failed investment in Texas oil wells. A judge decided Epstein
owed him nothing.

"It's a bad memory. I would rather not have ever met Jeffrey Epstein," said Michael Stroll, the
retired former president of Williams Electronics and Sega Corp. "Suffice it to say I have
nothing good to say about him."
Among the characteristics most attributed to Epstein is a penchant for women.
He has been linked to Maxwell, a fixture on the high-society party circuits in both New York
and London. Previous girlfriends are said to include a former Ms. Sweden and a Romanian
Y
model.
P
O
"He's a lot of fun to be with," Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002. "It is even said
that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of themC are on the younger side. No
doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
D
Investigation leads to Epstein E
I
Although he was not a frequenter of the Palm BeFach social scene, he made his presence felt.
Among his charitable donations, he gave $90,0I00 to the Palm Beach Police Department and
T
$100,000 to Ballet Florida.
R
In Palm Beach, he lived in luxury.E Three black Mercedes sat in his garage, alongside a green
Harley-Davidson. His jet waitCed at a hangar at Palm Beach International Airport. At home, a
private chef and a small staff stood at the ready. From a window in his mansion, he could look
A
out on the Intracoastal Waterway and the West Palm Beach skyline. He seemed to be a man
who had everything.
T
O
But extraordinary wealth can fuel extraordinary desires.
N
>> Epstein wants to leave jail for mansion in sex-trafficking case
In March 2005, a worried mother contacted Palm Beach police. She said another parent had
overheard a conversation between their children.
Now the mother was afraid her 14-year-old daughter had been molested by a man on the
island.
The phone call triggered an extensive investigation, one that would lead detectives to Epstein
but leave them frustrated.
Palm Beach police and the state attorney's office have declined to discuss the case. But a Palm
Beach police report detailing the criminal probe offers a window into what detectives faced as
they sought to close in on Epstein.
Detectives interviewed the girl, who told them a friend had invited her to a rich man's house to
perform a massage. She said the friend told her to say she was 18 if asked. At the house, she
said she was paid $300 after stripping to her panties and massaging the man while he
masturbated. Y
P
Police interview 5 alleged victims
O
The investigation began in full after the girl identified Epstein inC a photo as the man who had
paid her. Police arranged for garbage trucks to set aside Epstein 's trash so police could sift
D
through it. They set up a video camera to record the comings and goings at his home. They
E
monitored an airport hangar for signs of his private jet's arrivals and departures.
I
F
They quickly learned that the woman who took the 14-year-old girl to Epstein's house was
I
Haley Robson, a Palm Beach Community CTollege student from Loxahatchee. In a sworn
statement at police headquarters, Robson, then 18, admitted she had taken at least six girls to
R
visit Epstein, all between the ages of 14 and 16. Epstein paid her for each visit, she said.
E
C
During the drive back to her house, Robson told detectives, 'Tm like a Heidi Fleiss."
A
Police interviewed five alleged victims and 17 witnesses. Their report shows some of the girls
said they had been ins tructed to have sex with another woman in front of Epstein, and one said
T
she had direct intercourse with him.
O
In OctoNber, police searched the Palm Beach mansion. They discovered photos of naked, young
looking females, just as several of the girls had described in interviews. Hidden cameras were
found in the garage area and inside a clock on Epstein's desk, alongside a girl's high school
transcript.
Two of Epstein's former employees told investigators that young-looking girls showed up to
perform massages two or three times a day when Epstein was in town.
They said the girls were permitted many indulgences. A chef cooked for them. Workers gave
them rides and handed out hundreds of dollars at a time.
One employee told detectives he was told to send a dozen roses to one teenage girl after a high
school drama performance. Others were given rental cars. One, according to police, received a
$200 Christmas bonus.
The cops moved to cement their case. But as they tried to tighten the noose, they encountered
other forces at work.
In Orlando they interviewed a possible victim who told them nothing inappropriate had
Y
happened between her and Epstein. They asked her whether she had spoken to anyone else.
P
She said yes, a private investigator had asked her the same questions.

D
When they subpoenaed one of Epstein's former employees, he told them the same thing. He
and a private eye had met at a restaurant days earlier toE go over what the man would tell
investigators. I
F
Detectives received complaints that private eyeIs were posing as police officers. When they told
T
Epstein's local attorney, Guy Fronstin, he said the investigators worked for Roy Black, the
R
high-powered Miami lawyer who has defended the likes of Rush Limbaugh and William
E
Kennedy Smith.
C
While the private eyes were conducting a parallel investigation, Dershowitz, the Harvard law
A
professor, traveled to West Palm Beach with information about the girls. From their own
profiles on the popula r Web site MySpace.com, he obtained copies of their discussions about
T
their use of alcohol and marijuana.
O
He tookN his research to a meeting with prosecutors in early 2006, where he sought to cast
doubt on the teens' reliability.
The private eyes had dug up enough dirt on the girls to make prosecutors skeptical. Not only
did some of the girls have issues with drugs or alcohol but also some had criminal records and
other troubles, Epstein's legal team claimed. And at least one of them, they said, lied when she
told police she was younger than 18 when she started performing massages for Epstein.
After the meeting, prosecutors postponed their decision to take the case to a grand jury.
In the following weeksi police received complaints that two of the victims or their families had
been harassed or threatened. Epstein's legal team maintains that its private investigators did
nothing illegal or unethical during their research.
By theni relations between police and prosecutors were fraying. At a key meeting with
prosecutors and the defensei Detective Joseph Recarey, the lead investigator, was a no-showi
according to Epstein's attorney.
Y
"The embarrassment on the prosecutor's face was evident when the police officer never
P
showed up for the meeting/' attorney Jack Goldberger said.
O
Later in Aprili Recarey walked into a prosecutor's office at the staCte attorney's office and
learned the case was taking an unexpected turn.
D
The prosecutori Lanna Belohlaveki told Recarey the stEate attorney's office had offered Epstein
a plea deal that would not require him to serve jail ti I me or receive a felony conviction.
F
Recarey told her he disapproved of the plea ofIfer.
T
The deal never came to passi howeverR.
E
Future unclear after charge
C
On May 1 the department a sked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Epstein on four
i A
counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor and to charge his personal assistanti Sarah
Kellen, now 27i fTor her alleged role in arranging the visits. Police officials also wanted to
charge RobsOoni the self-described Heidi Pleiss, with lewd and lascivious acts.
N
By theni the department was frustrated with the way the state attorney's office had handled the
case. On the same day the warrants were requested) Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter
wrote a letter to State Attorney Barry Krischer suggesting he disqualify himself from the case if
he would not act.
Two weeks lateri Recarey was told that prosecutors had decided once again to take the case to
the grand jury.
It is not known how many of the girls testified before the grand jury. But Epstein's defense
team said one girl who was subpoenaed - the one who said she had sexual intercourse with
Epstein - never showed up.
The grand jury's indictment was handed down in July. It was not the one the police
department had wanted.
Instead of being slapped with a charge of unlawful sexual activity with a minor, Epstein was
Y
charged with one count of felony solicitation of prostitution, which carries a maximum penalty
P
of five years in prison. He was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail early July 23 and
O
released hours later.
C
Epstein's legal team "doesn't dispute that he had girls over for m assages," Goldberger said. But
D
he said their claims that they had sexual encounters with him lack credibility.
E
"They are incapable of being believed," he said. "TheIy had criminal records. They had
F
accusations of theft made against them by their employers. There was evidence of drug use by
I
some of them."
T
R
What remains for Epstein is yet to be seen.
E
The Palm Beach Police Department has asked the FBI to investigate the case. It also has
C
returned the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.
A
In New York, candidates for governor and state attorney general have vowed to return a total
T
of at least $60,000 in campaign contributions from Epstein. Meanwhile, Epstein's powerful
O
friends have remained silent as tabloids and Internet blogs feast on tl}e public details of the
police iNnvestigation.
Goldberger maintains Epstein's innocence but says the legal team has not ruled out a future
plea deal. He insists Epstein will emerge in the end with his reputation untarnished.
"He will recover from this," he said.

TRUMP SNAGS GOSMAN ESTATE FOR $41 MILLION
O
When it came time to bid Monday for the palatial Palm Beach digs of Abe Gosman, The
C
Donald was not about to be trumped.
"Nobody was going to outbid me," the brash developer-turned- TV-personality said from his
D
New York office.
Trump bested two other bidders with a $41.35 million offer for the 43,000-square-foot,
E
seven-bedroom estate on 6 oceanfront acres along the storied "Raider's Row."
But Trump, 58, proud possessor of Mar-a-Lago, haIs no plans to live in the Gosman home at
F
513 N. County Road. He wants to - what else? - sell it and make more money.
The star of the mega-hit The Apprentice saidI he intends to redevelop the site into a "super
T
luxury house" that would be the "finest anywhere in the United States." He might build
another house before flipping the entRire package.
"I've known about this house for quite some time," Trump said. "It's probably the best piece
E
of land in Florida - and probably the country - for luxury real estate."
Although Trump said he couCld subdivide the property into nine lots, Palm Beach Mayor
Lesly Smith said zoning regulations allow for only two houses - and maybe a third. Smith
said she's not worried about Trump's plans.
A
"He's been a very good property owner in the town of Palm Beach," she said. "He does his
projects very well. H e's a perfectionist."
T
Monday's auction took place at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in West Palm Beach as part of
Gosman's COhapter 7 bankruptcy case. Proceeds from the sale will go into escrow for eventual
distribution to creditors.
N
The auction began at exactly noon after Judge Steven Friedman dismissed an objection from
an attorney representing money manager Jeffrey Epstein. The lawyer argued unsuccessfully
that Trump was not a qualified bidder because his contract stipulated that he would not close
on the sale unless title insurance was in place beforehand.
With Trump listening via conference call, Epstein began the bidding at $3 7 .25 million -
$250,000 higher than Trump's initial offer.
Mark Pulte, son of the founder of home-building giant Pulte Homes, passed when his turn
came, letting lawyers for Trump and Esptein bid against each other until the price hit $38.85
million.
Pulte then bid $39.1 million, briefly raising the ire of Trump, who believed that Pulte had
given up his right to bid by passing the first time.
But Friedman allowed the offer to stand, and Pulte and Trump went back and forth until
Pulte dropped out at $41.1 million. Epstein, a part-time Palm Beach resident, bowed out at
$38.6 million.
Friedman closed the bidding 10 minutes after it started, leaving Trump with the right to buy
the 29,000-square-foot home (a typical Palm Beach County single-family house is about
2,200 square feet). The property also has a tennis house, a pool house and 1930s-era service
quarters.
The closing could take place within a week but probably won't happen until next month.
Trustee Joe Luzinski and creditors said they were pleased with the outcome. Y
"We knew we were dealing with some substantial people ... who were going to bid it up a
P
bit," Luzinski said.
"The system worked," said Charles Tatelbaum, a lawyer for creditor OJPMorgan Chase Bank.
"In bankruptcy court, the idea is to get the most for creditors, and that's what happened."
C
The auction proved to be a bonanza for creditors, Luzinski said, noting that the highest offer
former listing agent Sotheby's International Realty received wa s $32 million. Sotheby's won't
receive a commission, he said. D
Pulte, 42, of Boca Raton, said he figured Trump wouldn't back down Monday.
E
"I got the feeling he was willing to go a lot higher, and I didn't want to chase it," Pulte said.
Pulte said Gosman asked him before the auction whIether he would be willing to let him stay
F
in the mansion after the closing until he decides where he wants to move. Trump and
Luzinski said they have had no such discussioIns with Gosman.
Gosman, 75, had the house built after payTing $12.1 million for the land in 1986.
The former health-care magnate declined interview requests before and after the auction
R
Monday. He was at the courthouse but left before the auction took place.
The $41.35 million price tag ecliEpses the $30.35 million sale of Lowell "Bud" Paxson's Palm
Beach home and guest house but falls short of the $45 million that Virginia home builder
C
Dwight Schar paid for Ron Perelman's 26,000-square-foot estate, Casa Apava, a designated
landmark.
A
Schar also paid $18.6 million for a lakefront lot across the street from the main house, for a
total of $63.6 millio n. Insiders say Schar spent a total of $70 million for his new property,
T
making it the priciest residential sale in U.S. history.
Gosman onOce had a fortune that Forbes magazine estimated at $480 million. He voluntarily
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001, listing assets of $250 million and
liabilitNies of $23 3. 6 million.
When a judge ruled that Gosman had to give up all of his exempt assets to creditors if he
wanted to reorganize under Chapter 11, Gosman converted the case to Chapter 7 liquidation.
Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Larry Lessen ruled that Abe and Lin Gosman's marriage is
invalid because Florida law does not recognize a Dominican Republic divorce that Lin
Gosman tried to obtain from another man, Michael Castre.
The judge's decision was a huge victory for creditors because it prevents Abe Gosman from
protecting assets by claiming joint ownership with his wife. Gosman's assets, which include
an extensive collection of artwork, could total as much as $70 million and will be sold later.
Without Lessen's ruling, Luzinski would have had a much harder time selling Gosman's
estate, said David Cimo, special counsel for the trustee.
"We would have been thwarted ... or at least substantially impaired," Cimo said.
The trustee alleged during a weeklong trial in May that Gosman fraudulently gave his wife
an ownership interest in his home and other belongings only to avoid losing them in
bankruptcy. Gosman has denied any wrongdoing, saying he made the property transfers in
1999, well before he filed for bankruptcy.
Lessen is expected to rule in the next two months whether Gosman made improper transfers,
a decision that will affect how much money will be available to creditors.
Cimo acknowledged that Monday wasn't the best of days for the Gosmans but said they were
willing to move forward, in part because the upkeep of the estate now exceeds their means.
"This is not a happy occasion for them, but at least we're moving to the next lYevel," Cimo
said. "That's not a house you want to live in unless you're making large amounts of money
P
like Donald Trump."

O
C
Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein paid to have underage girls and young
women brought to his home, where he received massages and sometimes sex,
D
according to an investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department.
E
Palm Beach police spent months sifting throuIgh Epstein's trash and watching his
F
waterfront home and Palm Beach International Airport to keep tabs on his
I
private jet. An indictment chargingT Epstein, 53, was unsealed Monday, charging
him with one count of felony sRolicitation of prostitution.
E
Palm Beach police thought there was probable cause to charge Epstein with
C
unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation.
A
Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry with State Attorney Barry Krischer' s
handling of the case that he wrote a memo suggesting the county's top
T
prosecutor disqualify himself.
O
"NI must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this
matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your
disqualification from the prosecution of these cases," Reiter wrote in a May 1
memo to Krischer.
While not commenting specifically on the Epstein case, Mike Edmondson,
spokesman for the state attorney, said his office presents cases other than
murders to a grand jury when there are questions about witnesses' credibility and
their ability to testify.

11/11/2019 After long probe, billionaire faces solicitation charge -News -The Palm Beach Post -West Palm Beach, FL
By the nature of their jobs, police officers look at evidence from a "one-sided
perspective," Edmondson said. "A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader
fashion," weighing the veracity of witnesses and how they may fare under
defense attorneys' questioning, he said.
Epstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger, said his client committed no crimes.
'The reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not
charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney questioned the credibility
Y
of the witnesses," Goldberger said. A county grand jury "found the allegations
P
wholly unsubstantiated and not credible," and that's why his client was not
O
charged with sexual activity with minors, he said.
C
Goldberger said Epstein passed a lie detector test admini stered by a reputable
D
polygraph examiner in which he said he did not know the girls were minors.
E
Also, a search warrant served on Epstein's home found no evidence to
corroborate the girls' allegations, GoldbergerI said.
F
I
According to police documents:
T
R
- A Palm Beach Community College student said she gave Epstein a massage in
the nude, then brought himE six girls, ages 14 to 16, for massage and sex-tinged
sessions at his home. C
- A 27-year-old Awoman who worked as Epstein's personal assistant also
facilitated the liaisons, phoning the PBCC student to arrange for girls when
T
Epstein was coming to town. And she escorted the girls upstairs when they
O
arrived, putting fresh sheets on a massage table and placing massage oils nearby.
N
- Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses. They
contend that on three occasions, Epstein had sex with the girls.
A money manager for the ultra-rich, Epstein was named one of New York's most
eligible bachelors in 2003 by The New York Post. He reportedly hobnobs with
the likes of former President Clinton, former Harvard University President
Lawrence Summers and Donald Trump, and has lavish homes in Manhattan,
New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.

campaigns ofJ oe Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles

Goldberger is one of five attorneys TEpstein has retained since he became the
subject of an investigation, EdmRondson said. Among the others: Alan
Dershowitz, the well-knowEn Harvard law professor and author, who is a friend
of Epstein. Dershowitz could not be reached for comment.
C
Police said the wAoman who enlisted young girls for Epstein was Haley Robson,
20, of Royal Palm Beach. Robson has worked at an Olive Garden restaurant in
T
Wellington and said she was a journalism major at Palm Beach Community
CollegOe when she was questioned by police last October. She has an unlisted
pNhone number and could not be reached for comment.
Robson said she met Epstein when, at age 17, a friend asked her if she would like
to make money giving him a massage. She said she was driven to his five
bedroom, 7 1/2-bath home on the Intracoastal Waterway, then escorted upstairs
to a bedroom with a massage table and oils. Epstein and Robson were both naked
during the massage, she said, but when he grabbed her buttocks, she said she
didn't want to be touched.

Epstein said he'd pay her to bring him more girls - the younger the better,
Robson told police. When she tried once to bring a 23-year-old woman to him,
Epstein said she was too old, Robson said.
Robson, who has not been charged in the case, said she eventually brought six
girls to Epstein who were paid $200 each time, Robson said. 'Tm like a Heidi
Pleiss," police quoted her as saying. The girls knew what to expect when they
were taken to Epstein's home, Robson said. Give a massage - maybe naked - and
Y
allow some touching.
P
One 14-year-old girl Robson took to meet Epstein led police to start the
O
investigation of him in March 2005. A relative of the girl called to say she
C
thought the child had recently engaged in sex with a Palm Beach man. The girl
then got into a fight with a classmate who accused her of being a prostitute, and
D
she couldn't explain why she had $300 in her purse.
E
The girl gave police this account of her meetiIng with Epstein:
F
I
She accompanied Robson and a second girl to Epstein's house on a Sunday in
T
February 2005. Once there, a woman she thought was Epstein's assistant told the
R
girl to follow her upstairs to a room featuring a mural of a naked woman, several
E
photographs of naked women on a shelf, a hot pink and green sofa and a massage
C
table.
A
She stripped to her bra and panties and gave him a massage.
T
Epstein gave the 14-year-old $300 and she and the other girls left, she said. She
O
said Robson told her that Epstein paid her $200 that day.
N
Other girls told similar stories. In most accounts, Epstein's personal assistant at
the time, Sarah Kellen, now 27, escorted the girls to Epstein's bedroom.
Kellen, whose most recent known address is in North Carolina, has not been
charged in the case.
Palm Beach police often conducted surveillance of Epstein's home, and at Palm
Beach International Airport to see if his private jet was there, so they would
know when he was in town. Police also arranged repeatedly to receive his trash

from Palm Beach sanitation workers, collecting papers with names and phone
numbers, sex toys and female hygiene products.
One note stated that a female could not come over at 7 p.m. because of soccer.
Another said a girl had to work Sunday - "Monday after school?" And still
another note contained the work hours of a girl, saying she leaves school at 11 :30
a.m. and would come over the next day at 10:30 a.m.
Only three months before the police department probe began, Epstein donated
Y
$90,000 to the department for the purchase of a firearms simulator, said Jane

Famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz met with the Palm Beach County

who say they gave his client, Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, sexually
E
charged massages, according to police reports.
I
F
The reports also state that another Epstein attorney agreed to a plea bargain that

would have allowed Epstein to haveT no criminal record. His current attorney
denies this happened.

And the documents also reveal that the father of at least one girl complained that

Police also talk ed to somebody who said she was offered money if she refused to

O
TNhe state attorney's office said it presented the Epstein case to a county grand
jury this month rather than directly charging Epstein because of concerns about
the girls' credibility. The grand jury indicted Epstein, 53, on a single count of
felony solicitation of prostitution, which carries a maximum penalty of five years
in prison.
Police believed there was probable cause to charge Epstein with the more serious
crimes of unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation.
Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry that he wrote State Attorney Barry
Krischer a memo in May suggesting he disqualify himself from the case.

11/11/2019 Police say lawyer tried to discredit teenage girls -News -Palm Beach Daily News -Palm Beach, FL
The case originally was going to be presented to the grand jury in February, but
was postponed after Dershowitz produced information gleaned from the Web
site myspace.com showing some of the alleged victims commenting on alcohol
and marijuana use, according to the police report prepared by Detective Joseph
Recarey.
Haley Robson, a 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she
recruited girls for Epstein, also is profiled on myspace.com. Her page includes
photos of her and her friends, including one using the name "Pim pin' MYade EZ."
Robson, who was not charged in the case, is a potential prosecutionP witness.
O
According to Recarey, prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek offered Epstein attorneys
C
Dershowitz and Guy Fronstin a plea deal in April. Fronstin, after speaking with
Epstein, accepted the deal, in which Epstein would plead guilty to one count of
D
aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, be placed on five years'
E
probation and have no criminal record. The deal also called for Epstein to submit
I
to a psychiatric and sexual evaluation and have no unsupervised visits with
F
minors, according to Recarey's report. TIhe plea bargain was made in connection
T
with only one of the five alleged victims, the report states.
R
Fronstin - who declined to comment on the case - was subsequently fired and
E
veteran defense attorney Jack Goldberger was hired. He denies there was any
C
agreement by any of Epstein's attorneys to a plea deal.
A
"We absolutely did not agree to a plea in this case," he said. Neither Belohlavek
nor a stateT attorney's spokesman could be reached for comment.
O
The parent or parents of alleged victims who complained of being harassed by
N
private investigators provided license tag numbers of two of the men. Police
found the vehicles were registered to a private eye in West Palm Beach and
another in Jupiter, according to Recarey's report.
"I have no knowledge of it," defense attorney Goldberger said.
The report also says a woman connected to the Epstein case was contacted by
somebody who was still in touch with Epstein. That person told her she would
be compensated if she didn't cooperate with police, Recarey's report says. Those

who did talk "will be dealt with," the woman said she was told. Phone records
show the woman talked with the person who allegedly intimidated her around
the time she said, Recarey reported.
Phone records also show that the person said to have made the threat then
placed a call to Epstein's personal assistant, who in turn called a New York
corporation affiliated with Epstein, the report states.
Y
The issue in the Epstein case is not whether females came to his waterfront
P
home, but whether he knew their ages.
O
"He's never denied girls came to the house," Goldberger said. But when Epstein
C
was given a polygraph test, "he passed on knowledge of age," the attorney said.
D
After the indictment against Epstein was unsealed this week, Police Chief Reiter
E
referred the matter to the FBI. "We've received the referral, and we're reviewing
I
it," said FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela Fin Miami.
I
The chief himself has come under aTttack from Epstein's lawyers and friends in
New York, where he has a homRe. The New York Post quoted Epstein's
prominent New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, as saying his client was indicted
E
only "because of the craziness of the police chief."
C
Reiter has declinAed to comment on the case.
Prosecutors have not presented a sex-related case like Epstein's to a grand jury
T
before, said Mike Edmondson, spokesman for the state attorney's office. "That's
O
what you do with a case that falls into a gray area," he said.
N
The state attorney's office did not recommend a particular criminal charge on
which to indict Epstein, Edmondson said. The grand jury was presented with a
list of charges from highest to lowest, then deliberated with the prosecutor out of
the room, he said.
"People are surprised at the grand jury proceeding," West Palm Beach defense
attorney Richard Tendler said. "It's a way for the prosecutor's office to not take
the full responsibility for not filing the (charge), and not doing what the Palm
Beach Police Department wanted. I think something fell apart with those
underage witnesses."

Defense attorney Robert Gershman was a prosecutor for six years. "Those girls
must have been incredible or untrustworthy, I don't know," he said.
Other attorneys said Epstein's case raises the issue of whether wealthy, connected
defendants like Epstein - whose friends include former President Clinton and
Donald Trump - are treated differently from others. Once he knew he was the
subject of a criminal probe, Epstein hired a phalanx of powerful attorneys such as

Expert: Ignorance of age isn't
defense in sex cases
Posted Aug 5, 2006 at 12:01 AM
Updated Oct 3, 2019 at 1: 38 PM
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This story originally published in The
Y
Palm Beach Post on Aug. 5, 2006)
P
O
Even if Palm Beach money manager Jeffrey Epstein didn't
C
know that girls who police say gave him sexual massages at
his Intracoastal home were under the legal ag e, that alone
D
wouldn't have exempted him from criminal charges of
E
sexual activity with minors.
I
F
"Ignorance is not a valid defense," said Bob Dekle, a legal
I
skills professor who wasT a Lake City prosecutor for nearly
30 years, half of thatR time specializing in sex crimes against
children.
E
C
"There is no knowledge element as far as the age is
concerned," Dekle said.
A
After an 11-month investigation, Palm Beach police said
T
there was probable cause to charge Epstein, 53, with
O
unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious
N
molestation. They contend that Epstein - friend of the rich
and famous and financial patron of Democratic Party
organizations and candidates - committed those acts with
five underage girls.
In the past week, New York Attorney General and
gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer has returned about
$50,000 in campaign contributions he received from
Epstein, and Mark Green, a candidate to replace Spitzer in
his current job, has returned $10,000 to him because of the
Palm Beach scandal, the New York Daily News has
reported.
Rather than file charges, the state attorney's office
presented the case to a county grand jury. The panel
indicted Epstein last week on a single, less serious charge of
felony solicitation of prostitution.
The case raised eyebrows because the state attorney's office
Y
rarely, if ever, kicks such charges to a grand jury. And it
P
increases the difficulty of prosecuting child sex abuse cases,
O
especially when the defendant is enormously wealthy and
C
can hire high-priced, top-tier lawyers.
D
At least one of Epstein's alleged victims told police he knew
E
she was underage when the two of them got naked for
massages and sexual activity. She wIas 16 years old at the
F
time and said Epstein asked her questions about her high
I
school, according to poliTce reports.
R
A girl who said she met Epstein when she was 15 said he
E
told her if she told anybody what happened at his house,
C
bad things could happen, the police reports state.
A
Epstein's youngest alleged victim was 14 when she says she
Tgave him a massage that included some sexual activity. She
Ois now 16. The girl's father says he doesn't know whether
she told Epstein her age.
N
"My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me
because of sheer embarrassment," he said. "But she very
much looked 14. Any prudent man would have had second
thoughts about that."
Defense attorney Jack Goldberger maintains that not only
did Epstein pass a polygraph test showing he did not know
the girls were minors, but their stories weren't credible.
The state attorney's office also implied that their credibility
was an issue when it decided not to charge Epstein directly,
but instead give the case to the grand jury.
"A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion," a
state attorney's spokesman said last week.

Epstein hired Harvard law Professor EAlan Dershowitz
when he became aware he was undIer investigation, and

Dershowitz gave prosecutors information that some of the

Prosecutors typically consider two things in deciding
whether to charge somebody with sex-related offenses
A
against minors - whether there is sufficient evidence and
Twhether there is a public interest in doing so, Dekle said.
O
If two teens are in a sexual relationship and the boy turns
N
18 before the girl, he could be charged with a sex crime if
the sex continues. There would be no public interest in
pursuing that, Dekle said.
But where there is a large gap in ages - and especially in
cases of teachers with students - there is a public interest in
prosecuting, he said. Likewise if the accused has a track
record of sex with minors.
Still there is a "universal constant" in prosecuting these
cases, Dekle said. Men who exploit underage children for
sex often carefully choose their victims in ways that will
minimize the risk to them, he said.
Victims usually are from a lower social status, and they may
suffer from psychological problems, Dekle said.
"Lots of child sexual abuse victims have been victimized by
multiple people over a period of time. Then the act of abuse
Y
produces behavior in the victims that further damages their
P
credibility." Examples include promiscuous behavior and
O
drug abuse.
C
Some of the alleged victims in the Epstein case returned to
D
his home multiple times for the massage sessions and the
E
$200 to $300 he typically paid them per visit. "That would
be a definite problem for the proseIcutor," said Betty Resch,
F
who prosecuted crimes against children in Palm Beach
I
County for five years andT now is in private practice in Lake
Worth. R
E
"The victim becomes less sympathetic" to a jury, Resch said.
C
"But she's a victim nevertheless. She's a kid."
A
Most men charged with sex crimes against minors look
Tnormal, Dekle said. A jury expecting to see a monster
seldom will. And the victims' ages work against them and in
O
favor of the defendant in a trial, Dekle said.
N
If a child and an adult tell different stories and both swear
they're telling the truth, adult jurors are more likely to
believe the adult, Dekle said.
"You have all these things working against you in a child
sex abuse case. Prosecutors normally try to be very careful
in filing those cases because they know what they're getting
into. There is no such thing as an iron-clad child sexual
abuse case."

Epstein camp calls female accusers
liars

(EDITOR'S NOTE: This story originally published in The
Y
Palm Beach Post on Aug. 8, 2006)
P
O
Attorneys and publicists for Palm Beach financier Jeffrey
C
Epstein went on the offensive Monday, contending that
teenage girls who have accused Epstein of sex ual
D
shenanigans at his waterfront home are liars and saying
E
that the Palm Beach Police Department is "childish."
I
F
"There never was any sex between Jeffrey Epstein and any
I
underage women/' his leTad attorney,Jack Goldberger, said
from Idaho where hRe was vacationing with his family.
E
Epstein did have young women come to his house to give
C
him massages, Goldberger said. "Mr. Epstein absolutely
insisted anybody who came to his house be over the age of
A
18. How he verified that, I don't know. The question is, did
Tanything illegal occur. The law was not violated here."
O
He had no explanation as to why Epstein would pay girls or
N
women with no massage training - as the alleged victims
said was the case - $200 to $300 for their visits. "The
credibility of these witnesses has been seriously
questioned/' Goldberger said.
Epstein, 53, was indicted by a county grand jury last month
on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution. After an
11-month investigation that included sifting through
Epstein's trash and surveilling his home, Palm Beach police
concluded there was enough evidence to charge him with
sexual activity with minors. When the grand jury indicted
Epstein on the less serious charge Police Chief Michael
1
Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether
there were federal law violations.
After a spate of stories about the case last week New York
1
publicist Dan Klores - whose client list has included Paris
Hilton and Jennifer Lopez - said on Saturday that Epstein's
camp was ready "to get their story out."
They did that Monday via Goldberger and a Los Angeles
Y
publicist for Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black,
P
who also has represented Epstein in the case.
O
"We just think there has been a distorted view Cof this case
in the media presented by the Palm Beach police,"
D
Goldberger said.
E
Reiter has consistently declined to comment on the case
I
F
and did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

N
The implication that State Attorney Barry Krischer was
easy on Epstein by presenting the case to a grand jury
rather than filing charges directly against him is wrong,
Goldberger said.
The Palm. Beach Police Department was "happy and
ecstatic" that the panel was going to review the evidence. "I
think what happened is they weren't happy with the result.
They decided to use the press to embarrass Mr. Epstein."
But records show that Reiter wrote Krischer on May 1 -
well before the case went to the grand jury - suggesting that
Krischer "consider if good and sufficient reason exists to
require your disqualification from. the prosecution of these
cases. " Y
P
Rather than flat-out decline to charge Epstein, Krischer
O
referred the case to the grand jury to "appease" the chief,
C
Goldberger said.
D
A state attorney's spokesman would say only that the office
E
refers cases to the grand jury when there are issues with the
viability of the evidence or witnessIes' credibility.
F
I
Both the state attorney and the grand jury concluded there
T
was not sufficient evidence that Epstein had sex with
R
minors, according to Goldberger. "It was just a childish
E
performance by the Palm. Beach Police Department,"
C
Goldberger said.
A
The defense attorney said one of the alleged victims who
Tclaimed she was a minor was in fact over the age of 18.
Another alleged victim. who was subpoenaed to testify to
O
the grand jury failed to do so. Epstein's accusers, he added,
N
have histories of drug abuse and thefts. "These worn.en are
liars. We've established that."
But why would they all invent their stories about meeting
Epstein for sexual massages?
"I don't have an answer as to what was the motivation for
these worn.en to com.e forward and m.ake these allegations,"
Goldberger said.

Delays in Epstein case unusual,
lawyers say
Posted Mar 13, 2007 at 12:01 AM
Updated Oct 3, 2019 at 3:48 PM
(EDITORS NOTE: This story originally published in The Palm
Y
Beach Post March 13, 2007)
P
O
A federal probe or a plea deal could explain the wait in the
C
Palm Beacher' s solicitation case.
D
Nearly eight months after Palm Beach tycoon Jeffrey
Epstein was charged with felony soliEcitation of prostitution,
there has been no discernible progIress in his case. No
F
witnesses deposed. No trial date set. Nothing, save for
I
routine court hearings reTset without explanation.
R
"Usually that would be unusual," said criminal defense
E
attorney Glenn Mitchell, who has no involvement in the
C
case.
A
"As a general rule, it would be unusual for nothing to have
happened," agreed Michael Dutko, a criminal defense
T
attorney in Fort Lauderdale. He represents Haley Robson,
O
20, of Royal Palm Beach, potentially a key witness in the
N
case.
A routine hearing for Epstein was pulled from the court
docket last week and reset for May 16. The delays and
inaction could be due to a potential federal probe of Epstein
or because a plea deal is in the works, attorneys say.
Unusual is the word that best describes everything about
the case against Epstein, 54, an enigmatic money manager
in New York City who counts Bill Clinton and Donald
Trump among his friends.
"Highly unusual" is how Palm Beach Police Chief Michael
Reiter described State Attorney Barry Krischer' s handling
of the case in a bluntly critical letter to Krischer last year
before Epstein was indicted.
Reiter referred the matter to the FBI to determine whether
any federal laws had been violated. Epstein's allies
countered by attacking the chief personally and
professionally.
Y
Reiter's department investigated Epstein for 11 months.
P
Police sifted repeatedly through his trash and conducted
O
surveillance on his five-bedroom, 7 1/2-bath, 7,234-square
C
foot home on the Intracoastal Waterway.
D
Police said Epstein paid women and girls as young as 14 to
E
give him erotic massages at his home. Police thought there
I
was probable cause to charge him with unlawful sex acts
F
with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation.
I
T
Epstein responded by hiring a phalanx of lawyers. One of
R
them, Harvard law professor and author Alan Dershowitz,
E
provided the state attorney's office with information about
C
alcohol and marijuana use by some of the girls who said
they wAere with Epstein.
TProsecutors then referred the case to the grand jury rather
Othan file charges directly against Epstein.
N
Epstein's attorneys deny he had sex with underage girls.
The lawyers say the girls' stories are not credible. But if the
court file is any indicator, they've made no effort to depose
the girls.
Neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have sought to
question Robson, said Dutko, her attorney. She recruited
teenage girls to visit Epstein for massages and sexual
activity, Palm Beach police said, and presumably would be a
key witness.
Epstein's attorney Jack Goldberger did not return phone
messages.
A source close to the case suggested it is languishing
pending a decision by the FBI on whether to refer it to
federal prosecutors.
"We still have a pending case," FBI spokeswoman Judy
Orihuela said Monday.
Y
State Attorney Krischer did not return a call for comment.
P
His spokesman, Mike Edmondson, declined to say whether
O
federal investigators are delaying the Epstein case. But, he
added, "if another agency is looking at somethinCg, we
wouldn't want to step on their toes."
D
Attorneys say inertia in a criminal ca Ese often points to a
pending plea deal.
I
F
"It would not surprise me if sIomething has happened that's
T
not reflected in the court file," said Dutko, such as an
R
agreement that will be formalized later.
E
Defense attorney Marc Shiner said defense attorneys
C
sometimes put off overtly conducting discovery -- deposing
A
witnesses, requesting documents and the like -- because
doin g so creates more work for harried prosecutors who
T
may become angry and not offer a plea deal.
O
N"Sometimes defense lawyers, knowing that, will try and do
discovery without taking depositions," said Shiner, a former
prosecutor for 13 years.
Instead, they may conduct a below-the-radar probe such as
having a private investigator check out leads, he said.
Shiner and others say a plea deal for Epstein probably
would result in pretrial intervention, in which a defendant
may be ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation,
counseling or other conditions in return for dropping the
charge.
Edmondson, spokesman for State Attorney Krischer, said
there is no plea offer and no request for the prosecution to
show its cards.
"To my knowledge, it's never happened before on a filed
case," he said.

WOMAN SUES BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR, SAYS THEY HAD SEX WHEN SHE WAS 16
P
A billionaire investor, already facing jail in Palm Beach County on charges of soliciting underage
O
prostitutes, is being sued by a young woman who says he had sex with her when she was 16 and had
sought his help becoming a model. C
The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, says financier Jeffrey Epstein had
the teen perform a sex act when she brought photographs of herself for him to review in his Upper
D
East Side mansion sometime in 2000.
Epstein, 54, a money manager, told the teen he managed fEinances for Victoria's Secret and "could get
you into the catalog" if she were "nice" to him, court papers say. The papers say being "nice"
I
included massages and other favors.
F
When the girl told Epstein, "I am 16 years old and just want to model," he replied, "Don't worry, I
I
won't tell anybody," court papers say.
T
Epstein, said by London's Mail on Sunday to be a close friend of England's Prince Andrew, has been
R
indicted in Palm Beach on charges of soliciting underage prostitutes. That case is pending.
The girl visited Epstein "several times over the several months and engaged in bizarre and unnatural
E
sex acts" while she was a minor, the lawsuit says.
Epstein "repeatedly requested thCat (the girl) return with her 14-, 15-, and 16-year-old girlfriends,
stating, 'Come by with your friends your age next time. Don't bring Sherrie (a mutual friend in her
40s). I love girls your age.A' "
The young woman, now 23, kept returning to Epstein because she has "mental issues," said her
lawyer, William J. Unroch. He refused to elaborate, but court papers say she was "disabled as a result
T
of severe mental disease and defect."
O
Epstein's lawyer in New York, Gerald Lefcourt, said, "The girl has admitted she is insane, but she can
read a newspaper and recognize the word 'rich."'
N
Lefcourt also said the statute of limitations has expired for the woman's case criminally and civilly,
and will almost certainly be dismissed.
He refused to comment on Epstein's Florida charges.
Meanwhile, Unroch, 57, also acknowledged that his client was living with him and was at the center
of a $10 million lawsuit he filed last year against a neighbor who said he was having sex with
underage girls. That case is pending.
"What she was doing at 22 is irrelevant to what happened to her when she was 16," Unroch said
Wednesday. He went on the say he hoped Epstein would agree to "do right" by his client and resolve
the case out of court.

Palm Beacher pleads in sex case

Y
Jeffrey Epstein will serve 1 1/2 years on teen solicitationP
charges. O
C
He lives in a Palm Beach waterfront mansion and has kept
company with the likes of President ClinDton, Prince
Andrew and Donald Trump, but investment banker Jeffrey
E
Epstein will call the Palm Beach County Jail home for the
I
next 18 months. F
I
T
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty Monday to felony solicitation of
R
prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for
prostitution. AfEter serving 18 months in jail, he will be
under houseC arrest for a year. And he will have a lifelong
obligation to register as a sex offender. He must submit to
A
an HIV test within 48 hours, with the results being
provided to his victims or their parents.
T
O
As part of the plea deaii federal investigators agreed to drop
Ntheir investigation of Epstein, which they had taken to a
grand jury, two law enforcement sources said.
Epstein was indicted two years ago after an 11-month
investigation by Palm Beach police. They received a
complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had
given Epstein a naked massage at his five-bedroom, 7,234-
square-foot, $8.5 million Intracoastal home.
Police concluded that there were several other girls brought
in 2004 and 2005 to an upstairs room at the home for
similar massages and sexual touching.
The indictment charged Epstein only with felony
solicitation of prostitution. The state attorney's office later
added the charge of procuring underage girls for that
purpose.
Prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek said of the plea: "I took into
consideration the length the trial would have been and
witnesses having to testify" about sometimes embarrassing
incidents.
Y
Epstein may have made a serious mistake soon after he was
P
charged. He rejected an offer to plead guilty to one count of
O
aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony,
C
according to police documents. He would have gotten five
years' probation, had no criminal record and not been a
D
registered sex offender, the documents indicate.
E
Epstein arrived in court Monday wIith at least three
F
attorneys. He wore a blue blazer, blue shirt, blue jeans and
I
white and gray sneakers.T After Circuit Judge Deborah Dale
Pucillo accepted the Rplea, he was fingerprinted. Epstein
then removed hiEs blazer and was handcuffed for the trip to
jail while his attorneys tried to shield him from
C
photographers' lenses.
A
When he eventually is released to house arrest, Epstein will
T
have to observe a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, have no
O
unsupervised contact with anyone younger than 18 and
Nneither own nor possess pornographic or sexual materials
"that are relevant to your deviant behavior," the judge said.
Epstein will be allowed to leave home for work. The New
York-based money manager told the judge he has formed
the not-for-profit Florida Science Foundation to finance
scientific research. 'Tm there every day," Epstein said.
The foundation was incorporated in November. Epstein
said he already has awarded money to Harvard and MIT.
When he is released from jail, there is a chance that Epstein
will be forced to move. Sex offenders are not allowed to live
within 1,000 feet of a school, park or other areas where
children may gather. No determination has been made as to
whether Epstein's home complies, but attorneys said it
likely does.
Sex offenders also typically must attend counseling sessions.
Belohlavek said that was waived for Epstein because his
private psychiatrist is working with him. The judge was Y
skeptical but agreed to it. P
O
Epstein's legal woes don't end with Monday's plea. There
C
are four pending federal civil lawsuits and one in state court
related to his behavior. At least one woman has sued him in
D
New York, where he owns a 51,000-square-foot Manhattan
E
mansion.
I
F
"It's validation of what we're saying in the civil cases," said
I
Miami attorney Jeffrey HTerman, who represents the alleged
victims in the federaRl lawsuits. West Palm Beach attorney
Ted Leopold repEresents one alleged victim in a civil suit in
state court. He said he anticipates amending that lawsuit to
C
add "a few other clients" as well.
A
In the criminal case, police went so far as to scour Epstein's
T
trash and conduct surveillance at Palm Beach International
O
Airport, where they watched for his private jet so they
Nwould know when he was in town. They concluded that
Epstein paid girls $200 to $300 each after the massage
sess10ns.
'Tm like a Heidi Pleiss," Haley Robson, now 22, told police
about her efforts in recruiting girls for Epstein.
There was probable cause to charge Epstein with unlawful
sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation,
police concluded.
The state attorney's office said questions about the girls'
credibility led it to take the unprecedented step of
presenting the evidence against Epstein to a grand jury,
rather than directly charging him.
Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter was furious with
State Attorney Barry Krischer, saying in a May 2006 letter
that the prosecutor should disqualify himself. "I continue to
find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual,"
he wrote. He then asked for and got a federal investigation. Y

Epstein hired a phalanx of high-priced lawyers - including

E
Not much has changed, even though he now resides in a

dorm at the Palm Beach CountFy Sheriffs Office's 17-acre,
967-bed stockade near the faIirgrounds.
T
During his first monRth of confinement, Epstein was visited
by the female assistant who, girls told police, had escorted
E
them to the room at his mansion where they gave him
C
naked massages.
A
Also trekking to the jail was a young woman whom Epstein
T
purportedly described as his Yugoslavian sex slave.
O
The wealthy financier and science wonk also has been
N
visited by an expert on artificial intelligence, as well as a
man who is a mixed martial arts aficionado and sometime
movie stuntman.
The only other people to visit him at the jail, according to
records, are a Singer Island man and an individual who
listed Epstein's Palm Beach address as his own.
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty on June 30 to two prostitution
related charges and was sentenced to 18 months in jail,
followed by a year of house arrest. Epstein paid teenage
girls $200 to $300 in 2004 and 2005 for massages in his
home that sometimes included sexual touching, Palm Beach
police said.
His jail visitors in July included:
- Sarah Kellen, 29, who some of the teen masseuses said
phoned them when Epstein was in town and escorted them
upon their arrival at his Palm Beach waterfront home to an
upstairs room, where she prepared the massage table and
Y
provided the oils for their encounters with him. Kellen
P
visited Epstein three times in July, according to a jail
O
visitor's log. Kellen lists a Manhattan home address.
C
Reached by telephone she declined to discuss Epstein.

police. One girl told police that Epstein instructed
I
Marcinkova and her to kTiss and have sex while he watched
and masturbated. AnRother said she engaged in sex with
Marcinkova at EEpstein's urging. Marcinkova visited Epstein
in jail four times in 13 days. She lists her address as on the

A
enormous apartment.
T
- Roger Schank 62 founder of the Institute for Leaming
1 1
O
Sciences at Northwestern University and an expert on

written numerous books on that subject and has a doctorate
degree from Yale University in linguistics. He was one of 19
people who applied to be president of Florida Atlantic
University in 2003. He became "chieflearning officer" at the
online Trump University in 2005. Schank listed his address
as being in Stuart and records show he also owns a home
1
in Lake Worth.
Epstein has financed a number of scientists over the years,
including Nobel Prize winners. He gave $30 million to
Harvard University in 2003. In November, he formed the
not-for-profit Florida Science Foundation, which he said
finances scientific research.
- Igor Zinoviev, a Russian mixed martial arts fighter, who
coaches a Chicago team in the International Fight League.
He also has worked as a personal trainer, celebrity

Billionaire sex offender leaves jail
six days a week for work
Posted Jul 1, 2008 at 12:01 AM
Updated Oct 4, 2019 at 9:27 AM
Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who's serving 18
Y
months in jail for soliciting an underage girl for
P
prostitution, is allowed to leave the Palm Beach County
O
Stockade six days a week on a work-release program.
C
Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Bea ch County
D
Sheriffs Office, confirmed that Epstein, 55, has been in the
E
work-release program since Oct. 10.
I
F
"He works six days a week: Friday through Wednesday 10
I
a.m. to 10 p.m.," Barbera said via e-mail. "(He) works at his
T
local West Palm Beach office, monitored on an active GPS
R
system (he wears an ankle bracelet). Mr. Epstein hires a
E
permit deputy, at his expense, for his own security at his
C
workplace during the time he is out."
A
Miami attorney Jeffrey Herman represents six young
Twomen who've sued Epstein, claiming he sexually abused
Othem at his Palm Beach home when they were minors.
N
Herman said he received a letter about the work-release
program from the U.S. Attorney's Office within the past
few days. But Herman says Epstein had been out on work
release for several weeks before the notification.
"My clients expressed shock and disappointment," Herman
said. "I find it incredible that he's on work-release in the
community and my clients aren't notified of this and we get
this letter weeks after the fact."
Jack Goldberger, Epstein's criminal attorney, said the
arrangement is not unusual.
"He goes to work every single day and goes back to jail at
night, just like everybody else (in the program),"
Goldberger said.
Epstein pleaded guilty June 30 to two felony counts:
soliciting prostitution and procuring a person under 18 for
prostitution. As part of the plea agreement, Epstein must
serve one year of house arrest and register as a lifelong sex
Y
offender.

Women want Epstein sex plea deal

P
O
Their attorneys will ask a judge to open Jeffrey Epstein's
C
records.
D
When wealthy money manager Jeffrey Epstein of Palm
Beach pleaded guilty last year to procEuring teens for
prostitution, his case detoured aroIund local and state rules
F
regarding the sealing of court documents.
I
T
At a plea conference on the state charges, a judge, a defense
R
lawyer and a prosecutor huddled at the bench and decided
E
that a deal Epstein had struck with federal prosecutors to
C
avoid charges should be sealed, according to a transcript of
the hearing.
A
And so it was.
T
O
But Florida rules of judicial administration, as well as rules
N
of the Palm Beach County court system, require public
notification that a court document has been or will be
sealed, meaning kept from public view. The rules also
require a judge to find a significant reason to seal, such as
protecting a trade secret or a compelling government
interest.
Yet no notification or reason occurred in Epstein's case,
according to court records.
Epstein's own attorneys, in federal filings, have referred to
his confidential deferred prosecution agreement with the
U.S. attorney's office, struck in September 2007, as
"unprecedented" and "highly unusual." And it was "a
significant inducement" for Epstein to accept the state's
deal, observed the state judge who accepted his plea,
County Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo.
Epstein now faces at least a dozen civil lawsuits in federal
and state courts filed by young women who said they had Y
sex with him and now are seeking damages. P
O
Attorneys for some of those women want his agreement
C
with federal prosecutors unsealed and will ask Circuit Judge
Jeffrey Colbath to do so today.
D
E
"It is against public policy for these documents to be have
been sealed and hidden from publicI scrutiny. As a member
F
of the public, E.W. has a right to have these documents
I
unsealed," wrote former TCircuit Judge Bill Berger, now in
private practice and Rrepresenting one of the women.
E
The Palm B C each Post also will ask Colbath to unseal the
agreement . Post attorney Deanna Shullman will argue that
A
the public has a right to know the specifics of Epstein's deal.
T
According to various media accounts, Epstein moved in
O
circles that included President Clinton, Donald Trump and
N
Prince Andrew. "International Moneyman of Mystery,"
declared a 2002 New York magazine profile of Epstein.
Epstein, 56, is in the Palm Beach County Stockade, serving
an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty nearly a year
ago to felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring
teenagers for prostitution.
He is allowed out from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., escorted by a
deputy, said Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office
spokeswoman Teri Barbera.
During a Palm Beach Police Department investigation, five
victims and 17 witnesses gave statements. They told of
young women brought by his assistants to Epstein's
mansion on El Brillo Way for massages and sexual activity
1
and then being paid afterward.
At Epstein's plea conference last year his attorney, Jack
1
Goldberger, and then-Assistant State Attorney Lanna
Belohlavek approached Pucillo in a sidebar conference.
Pucillo, who had left the bench nine years earlier, was Y
filling in temporarily as a senior judge. P
O
According to a transcript, Goldberger told Pucillo that
C
Epstein had entered a confidential agreement with the U.S.
attorney's office in which federal prosecutors brokered not
D
pursuing charges against him if he pleaded guilty in state
E
court. Pucillo then said she wanted a sealed copy of the
I
agreement filed in his case, andF Goldberger concurred that
he wanted it sealed. BelohlavIek later signed off on it.
T
The Florida SupremRe Court has expressed "serious concern"
and launched anE all-out inquiry into sealing procedures
across the state following media reports in 2006 of entire
C
cases being sealed and disappearing from court records.
A
"The public's constitutional right of access to court records
T
must remain inviolate, and this court is fully committed to
O
safeguarding this right/' justices wrote in their final report.
N
Epstein's office on Tuesday referred any questions to
Goldberger, who declined to comment. Pucillo also has
declined to comment.

Epstein secret pact with Feds
reveals "highly unusual" terms
Posted Jun 10, 2009 at 12:01 AM
Updated Oct 4, 2019 at 9:23 AM
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This story originally published in The
Y
Palm Beach Post on September 19, 2009)
P
O
A secret non-prosecution agreement multimillionaire
C
financier Jeffrey Epstein struck with federal prosecutors is
being called "highly unusual" by former federa l prosecutors
D
and downright outrageous by attorneys now representing
E
young women who serviced him.
I
F
The deal reveals that the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office
I
investigated him for seveTral federal crimes, including
engaging minors in Rcommercial sex. The crimes are
punishable by anywhere from 10 years to life in prison.
E
C
But federal prosecutors backed down and agreed to recall
grand jury subpoenas if Epstein pleaded guilty to
A
prostitution-related felonies in state court, which he
Tultimately did. He received an 18-month jail sentence, of
Owhich he served 13 months.
N
The U.S. Attorney's Office also agreed not to charge any of
Epstein's possible co-conspirators: Sarah Kellen, Adriana
Ross, Lesley Groff and Nadia Marcinkova.
The deal was negotiated in part by heavyweight New York
criminal defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt.
Unsealed on Friday after attorneys for some of Epstein's
victims and The Palm Beach Post sought its release, it offers
the first public look at the deal Epstein's high-powered legal
counsel brokered on his behalf.
Mark Johnson of Stuart, a former federal prosecutor,
described the disparity in potential sentences as unusual,
but even more so a provision on attorney payment.
The first draft of the agreement in September 2007
required that Epstein pay an attorney -- tapped by the U.S.
Attorney's Office and approved by Epstein -- to represent
some of the victims. That attorney is prominent Miami
lawyer Bob Josefsberg.
Y
But an addendum to the agreement signed the following
P
month struck Epstein's duty to pay Josefsberg if he and the
O
victims did not accept settlements -- capped at $150,000 -
C
and instead pursued lawsuits.
D
Johnson said it appears the government was trying to
E
balance the lesser sentence for Epstein with recovering
$150,000 for each victim. ''I've nevIer, ever seen anything
F
like that in my life," he said. "It's highly unusual."
I
T
The deal does not say whether any victims were contacted
R
or consulted before the deal was made.
E
Attorney BrCad Edwards of Fort Lauderdale, who represents
three of th e young women, believes that none of the 30 to
A
40 woman identified as victims in the federal investigation
Twere told ahead of time. Edwards said his clients received
letters from the U.S. Attorney's Office months after the deal
O
was signed, assuring them Epstein would be prosecuted.
N
"Never consulting the victims is probably the most
outrageous aspect of it," Edwards said. "It taught them that
someone with money can buy his way out of anything. It's
outrageous and embarrassing for United States Attorney's
Office and the State Attorney's Office."
Epstein now faces many civil lawsuits filed by the women,
who are represented by a variety of attorneys. In many, the
allegations are the same: that Epstein had a predilection for
teenage girls, identified poor, vulnerable ones and used
other young women to lure them to his Palm Beach
mansion. They walked away with between $200 and
$1,000.
Former Circuit Judge Bill Berger, also representing victims,
called the agreement a "sweetheart deal."
"Why was it so important for the government to make this
deal?'' Berger asked rhetorically. "We have not yet had an
honest explanation by any public official as to why it was
Y
made ... and why the victims were sold down the river."
P
O
Former federal prosecutor Ryon McCabe described the
agreement as "very unorthodox." Such agreemeCnts, he said,
are usually reserved for corporations, not indi viduals.
D
"It's very, very rare. I've never seen oEr heard of the
procedure that was set up here," saIid McCabe, who has no
F
involvement in any Epstein litigation.
I
T
"He's essentially avoiding federal prosecution because he
R
can afford to pay that many lawyers to help those victims
E
review their cases .... If a person has no money, he couldn't
C
be able to strike a deal like this and avoid federal
prosecutio n."
A
The backroom deal with federal prosecutors is all the more
T
interesting in light of the legal powerhouses who have
O
worked for Epstein including Harvard professor Alan
1
N
Dershowitz and Bill Clinton investigator Kenneth Starr.
Lefcourt is a past president of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers.
Epstein's local defense attorney,Jack Goldberger, issued a
statement Friday saying he had fought the release of the
sealed agreement to protect the third parties named there.
"Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and
conditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult
period in his life behind him. He is continuing his long
standing history of science philanthropy."
The investigation triggered tensions between police and
prosecutors, with then-Palm Beach .Chief Michael Reiter
saying in a May 2006 letter to then-State Attorney Barry
Krischer that the chief prosecutor should disqualify himself.
"I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases
highly unusual," Reiter wrote. He then asked for and got
the federal investigation that ended in the sealed deal.
"The Jeffrey Epstein matter was an experience of what a
Y
many-million-dollar defense can accomplish/' Reiter told
P
the Palm Beach Daily News upon his retirement.

JUDGE RULES EPSTEIN ATTORNEYS CAN SUBPOENA ABORTIOYN RECORDS
P
In a decision that could spark a constitutional showdown over privacy rights, a judge
Tuesday gave lawyers representing multimillionaire sex offender JefOfrey Epstein the right to
subpoena abortion records from women who are seeking millions in damages from the part
C
time Palm Beach resident.
Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele said the reco rds could help Epstein rebut
D
the women's claims that they suffered psychological ills after being paid to give him
sexually-charged massages at his Palm Beach mansion when they were as young as 14.
E
Hafele told Epstein's attorneys they couldn't go on a fishing expedition. The medical records,
he said, can't be sought until the women are asked wIhether they have ever had an abortion,
F
how many and where. Further, he said, the records would not be made public and might not
be admissible during trial. I
T
But, he said, since the women claim Epstein, now 57, is responsible for their emotional
distress, his attorneys can explore theR impact of other events. Medical records, Hafele said,
are a better source of information than a person's memory.
E
Attorney Louis Silver, who represents the Presidential Women's Health Center, a West Palm
Beach clinic where abortionCs are performed, warned Hafele that he was stepping on shaky
constitutional grounds.
"These records are protected by our constitutional right of privacy," he said, referring to the
A
Florida Constitution.
After the hearing, S ilver said an appeal won't be necessary until Epstein attorneys seek the
T
records.
In another Oruling Wednesday, Hafele also said that videos from depositions in the state cases
can't be released without a court order. The ruling came after Epstein attorney Robert Critton
N
complained that a video of Epstein being asked whether he had an "egg-shaped" penis
became a youtube.com sensation. It first appeared on The Palm Beach Post Web site.
Critton blamed attorney Spencer Kuvin for releasing it. Kuvin said it was public record.
The civil suits began mounting after Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state charges:
procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-
month sentence. As part of the deal brokered with federal prosecutors, he agreed not to
contest the accusations in the civil lawsuits. He can argue the women don't deserve the
millions they are seeking.

Epstein Journal's Findings Could
Resurrect Case

Y
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This story originally published in The
P
Palm Beach Post on March 20, 2010)
O
A purloined journal that is said to contain the nCames of
"hundreds" of victims of convicted sex offend er Jeffrey
D
Epstein could be used to reopen the investigation into the
E
multi-millionaire's appetite for teenage girls an attorney
1
I
representing seven of the victims said Friday.
F
I
New details about the contents of the journal were released
T
this week when Alfredo Rodriguez who worked as a
R 1
property manager for the Palm Beach resident, pleaded
E
guilty to obstruction of justice for lying to federal agents
C
when asked if he had any information about his former
boss' Acriminal activity. He later tried to sell the journal he
stole from Epstein for $50 000 to an unidentified person
1 1
T
who alerted authorities, according to court :records.
O
As part of the plea agreement, federal prosecutors said the
N
journal "contains information material to the Epstein
investigation, including the names of material witnesses
and additional victims."
"Had the items been produced in response to the inquiries
of state or federal authorities ... the materials would have
been presented to the federal grand jury," federal
prosecutors wrote.
Instead, prosecutors short-circuited the grand jury
investigation and cut a deal with Epstein. They agreed not
to pursue federal charges if he didn't contest prostitution
related felonies in state court. The money manager pleaded
guilty in July 2008 to procuring a minor for prostitution
and soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-
month sentence.
Attorney Adam Horowitz, who represents seven of the
roughly 18 women who have filed civil suits against Y
Epstein, said the new information could trump the so P
called non-prosecution agreement. O
C
The multifaceted agreement, he said, deals only with a
specific list of victims that the U.S. Attorney's Office knew
D
about when it penned the deal in 2007. If additional victims
E
are listed in the journal Rodriguez stole, Horowitz said
I
federal prosecutors could reopeFn the investigation.
I
"It opens the door for fuTrther prosecution," he said.
R
In addition to turning over the journal to federal agents,
E
Rodriguez told them he knew his former boss was having
C
sex with underage girls when he worked for him in 2004
and 2A005. He had seen naked girls, who looked like minors,
in the pool of Epstein's $8.6 million mansion. He had seen
T
pornographic images of young girls on Epstein's computer,
O
according to court records.
N
Neither Epstein's criminal defense attorney, Jack
Goldberger, nor attorney Robert Critton, who represents
Epstein in the civil lawsuits, could be reached. Federal
prosecutors have consistently declined comment.
The wording of the controversial agreement is unclear. It
says federal prosecutors would provide Epstein's attorneys
"with a list of individuals whom it has identified as victims."
Miami attorney Robert Josefsberg was appointed to
represent any of the victims on the list who wanted to
pursue Epstein in civil court. As part of the agreement
1
Epstein is to pay for Josefsberg to represent the women.
Some of the women, most identified as Jane Doe in
lawsuits, had already hired attorneys to represent them.
Some have since settled their suits with Epstein, although
terms were not disclosed.
Horowitz said he has filed court papers to get the journal Y
that Rodriguez stole. "It's another piece of evidence that
P
shows our clients were at Epstein's mansion," he said.
O
Rodriguez told prosecutors he didn't turn over Cthe journal
when both FBI and Palm Beach police asked f or it because
D
he wanted money for it. He also said he was afraid Epstein
E
would make him "disappear." The information, he told
I
investigators, was his "insurance policy."
F
I
He faces a maximum 20 years in prison when he is
T
sentenced on June 18.

Epstein paid three women $5.5 million to end underage
sex lawsuits
Y
By Jane.Musgrave

P
Updated Oct 4, 2017 at 12:46 AM
O
Ending years of speculation about how much Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein paid young
··-··-·-·•---'-•-··--·-···--··--•··-····
women who claimed he used them as sex toys, court documents Cfiled last week show he shelled
out $5.5 million to settle lawsuits with three of more than two dozen teens who sued him.
D
Responding to requests from Epstein's attorneys in a cEomplex lawsuit that was spawned by the
sex scandal, attorney Bradley Edwards said the politiIcally-connected 64-year-old convicted sex
F
offender paid more than $1 million to each of the three women Edwards represented.
I
T
Identified in court papers only by their initials or pseudonyms because of the nature of the
R
allegations and their youthful ages, L.M. was paid $1 million, E.W. $2 million and Jane Doe
E
$2.5 million, Edwards said of the settlements he negotiated with Epstein to end the lawsuits.
C
Jack Goldberger, one of Epstein's criminal defense attorneys, on Tuesday declined comment on
A
the revelations, citing confidentiality agreements that were part of the settlements. For the
same reason, he decli ned to say whether Epstein paid similar amounts to settle roughly two
T
dozen lawsuits filed by other young women against Epstein, claiming he paid them for sex
O
when some were as young as 14 years old.
N
Attorney Jack Scarola, who is representing Edwards, said his client was compelled to divulge
the confidential settlements to answer questions posed by Epstein's attorneys. "Brilliant move
on their part," he said.
Even if Epstein's attorneys hadn't opened the door, Scarola said the information would have
likely come out. He says the information will help him undermine Epstein's claims that
Edwards "ginned up" the allegations to help his former law partner, imprisoned and disbarred
Fort Lauderdale lawyer Scott Rothstein, perpetuate a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme.
The revelations of the settlements came as part of an ongoing lawsuit that started as a dispute
between Epstein and Rothstein, both billionaires.
A year after Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring a
minor for prostitution, he sued Rothstein and Edwards, claiming they trumped up the
allegations of sexual molestation to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme.
Rothstein was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010 after admitting he had built his wildly
Y
successful law firm by forging the names of federal judges and others to persuade investors he
P
had negotiated settlements in lawsuits against high-profile people. Investors were told they
O
could get a cut of the cash.
C
One of the high-profile people Rothstein used to lure investors was Epstein, according to a
D
lawsuit West Palm Beach attorney Robert Critton filed on Epstein's behalf. According to the
E
lawsuit, Rothstein told investors Epstein, a money manager, had agreed to settle the lawsuits
with the teens for $200 million - a claim Critton deIscribed as "a complete fabrication."
F
I
After Epstein dropped the lawsuit in 2012, Edwards turned the tables on him. Edwards accused
T
Epstein of filing the lawsuit maliciously to punish him for representing the young women.
R
Although Edwards was a partner in Rothstein's now defunct firm, Scarola claims Epstein had
E
no evidence Edwards was involved in the Ponzi scheme. Federal prosecutors successfully
C
charged other attorneys and members of the firm, but Edwards was never implicated, Scarola
said in the malicious prAosecution lawsuit.
The revelations aTbout the money Epstein paid to three of the young woman came last week in
documents filed for a hearing Tuesday in preparation for a December trial on the lawsuit.
O
N
Attorney Tonja Haddad Coleman, who represents Epstein, on Tuesday sought a delay of the
trial, in part, because she claimed she has been unable to talk to her client since his estate on his
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands was devastated last month by Hurricane Irma. ''I've had
no ability to communicate with Mr. Epstein," she said.
Pointing out Epstein's enormous wealth and his private jet Palm Beach County Circuit Judge
1
Donald Hafele rejected her request. While saying he didn't want to appear insensitive to those
victimized by the storm that hammered the Caribbean and roared through South Florida, he
said Coleman offered no proof such as an affidavit from Epstein to shore up her claims.
1 1
Still, Hafele gave Coleman extra time to respond to various motions that he will have to decide
before the case goes to trial.
Y
Despite Scarola's insistence that Edwards had nothing to do with Rothstein's Ponzi scheme,
P
Coleman said the evidence indicates otherwise. Why else would he try to depose Epstein's
O
well-known friends such as now President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and
1
C
illusionist David Copperfield, she asked. He used the celebrities as a draw, she said.
D
''The Epstein cases were used to fleece money and defraud investors," she said.
E
Edward's malicious prosecution case has been difficuIlt for both sides because both Epstein and
F
Edwards have refused to answer questions. As he did in the civil lawsuits, Epstein has invoked
I
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when questioned by Scarola. Edwards
T
has claimed that much of the information Epstein is seeking is protected by attorney-client
R
privilege.
E
C
The malicious prosecution lawsuit is one of two hotly-contested lawsuits that continue to pit
Edwards against Epstein. Ed wards also is suing the U.S. attorney's office, claiming it violated
A
the federal Crime Victims Rights Act when it negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with
Epstein. T
O
Only after federal prosecutors agreed to drop their investigation of Epstein, did he agree to
N
plead guilty to two prostitution charges in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. In federal court
records, prosecutors claim one of the key reasons they agreed to drop their case was Epstein's
agreement to settle lawsuits filed against him by dozens of his underage victims.

Judge rules feds' agreement with
Jeffrey Epstein pact violated teen
victims' rights
By Jane_M usgrave
Y
Posted Sep 17, 2019 at 4:02 PM
Updated Oct 8, 2019 at 12:31 PM P
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This story originally published in O The
Palm Beach Post on February 22, 2019)
C
Federal prosecutors violated the rights oDfJ effrey Epstein's
teenage victims by failing to reveal they had dropped plans
E
to prosecute the billionaire on dozens of federal charges in
I
connection with the girls' claimFs that he paid them for sex
at his Palm Beach mansion, UI.S. District Judge Kenneth
T
Marra ruled on Thursday.
R
In a blistering 3E3-page ruling, Marra meticulously and
methodicallCy detailed the numerous steps federal
prosecutors took to hide the agreement from more than 40
A
young women who claim Epstein paid them for sex when
they were as young as 14.
T
O
"While the government spent untold hours negotiating the
Nterms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's attorneys,
scant information was shared with the victims," Marra
wrote. "Instead, the victims were told to be 'patient' while
the investigation proceeded."
By then, it was too late. A deal had already been cut with
then-South Florida U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta and Epstein's
attorneys to shelve a 52-page federal indictment against
Epstein, a former math teacher turned money manager
who counts Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton
among his friends.
Prosecutors' failure to alert the young women about the
deal violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Marra ruled.
"At a bare minimum the (act) required the government to
inform (the young women) that it intended to enter into an
agreement not to prosecute Epstein," he wrote.
Still, Marra said he wasn't second-guessing prosecutors'
decision not to pursue Epstein on federal charges ifhe
pleaded guilty to minor state prostitution charges and
agreed to compensate his victims for the trauma he caused. Y
P
"The court is not ruling that the decision not to prosecute
O
was improper," Marra wrote. "The court is simply ruling
C
that, under the facts of this case, there was a violation under
the CVRA."
D
E
Further, he made no decision about what the remedy
I
should be. He gave prosecutors and attorneys representing
F
the young women 15 days to meet to decide how to unravel
I
the complex legal web thTat has been hanging over Epstein
and his young victimRs for more than a decade.
E
The chances an accord will be reached are slim, said
C
attorney Jack Scarola, who is representing the two Jane
DoesA who challenged the prosecutors' actions.
TFurther, he said, there is no road map to follow. The
Olawsuit attorney Bradley Edwards filed on behalf of the two
unidentified young women, claiming prosecutors violated
N
the federal act, is unique, he said.
"We are treading on virgin ground, to use what is probably
an inappropriate phrase in this situation," he said.
Scarola said he and Edwards will ask that the non
prosecution agreement be thrown out. That would open
the possibility that the long-shelved federal indictment
could be dusted off and filed against the 66-year-old
Epstein, who spends most of his time on a private island he
owns in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
"I don't see the government conceding to that remedy,"
Scarola admitted. Further, he said, it is likely Epstein will be
allowed to weigh in. Miami attorney Roy Black years ago
filed papers asking to intervene on Epstein's behalf.
The U.S. Attorney's Office said it wouldn't comment on
Marra's ruling. Neither Black nor New York City attorney
Jay Lefkowitz, who led efforts to bury the federal
indictment, responded to emails or phone calls for
comment. West Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberger, who Y
represents Epstein, also didn't respond. P
O
Scarola said it is likely Epstein's star-studded legal team will
C
argue that Epstein fully complied with the terms of the
agreement he made in 2007 with federal prosecutors and
D
therefore the agreement can't be undone.
E
I
As he promised, Epstein pleaded guilty in June 2008 to state
F
charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting
I
prostitution. He served 1T3 months of an 18-month jail term
in a vacant wing of tRhe county stockade that he was allowed
to leave 12 hourEs a day, six days week.
C
Further, as agreed, he paid settlements to the young women
who sAued him. While the settlements were confidential,
court records show he paid three women a total of $5.5
T
million.
O
In return, federal prosecutors held up their end of the
N
bargain. Their investigation ceased.
Having done all that prosecutors asked of him, Scarola said
Epstein will make a simple argument: "You can't turn
around and deprive me of the benefits I bargained for."
However, Scarola said, using Marra's ruling, he will counter
that the contract Epstein signed was illegal and therefore
unenforceable.
Even if Marra agrees to toss out the non-prosecution
agreement, Scarola conceded that doesn't mean Epstein will
face federal charges.
"The contract can be set aside and the federal government
can attempt to enter into the same agreement," he said.
"Except the spotlight of public attention will be on them
and the 40 victims will be able to explain to the court why
this sweetheart deal should not be approved."
Y
Scarola said that prosecutors may have had good reason not
P
to pursue Epstein. "There may be a reasonable explanation
O
but we don't know what that reason may have been," he
C
said.
D
In court papers, federal prosecutors have said that many of
E
the young women were afraid to cross the powerful,
I
politically connected money manager and simply refused to
F
testify against him.
I
T
In other cases, they said, the women changed their stories.
R
Jane Doe 2, who is trying to have the non-prosecution
E
agreement thrown out, initially described Epstein as "an
C
awesome man" and told prosecutors she hoped "nothing
happeAns" to him. While she later agreed to testify against
Epstein, prosecutors said they feared Epstein's attorneys
T
would use her words to destroy her if she ever took the
O
witness stand.
N
Marra, however, said the young woman's comments didn't
mean she wasn't entitled to know about the prosecutors'
plans to drop the charges. "There is no dispute that Epstein
sexually abused Jane Doe 2 while she was a minor," he
wrote. "Therefore, regardless of her comments to the
prosecutor, she was a victim."
Before the case is finally resolved, Scarola predicted that "a
lot of people are going to have to answer a lot of questions."
In his ruling, Marra detailed what appeared to be a cozy
relationship between Acosta, his line prosecutors and
Epstein's team oflawyers. His phalanx oflawyers included
noted Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth
Starr, the former U.S. solicitor general whose investigation
led to the impeachment of President Clinton.
Marra describes an October 2007 breakfast meeting
between Acosta, who is now U.S. labor secretary, and
Lefkowitz shortly after the non-prosecution agreement was Y
inked. P
O
After the meeting, Lefkowitz sent Acosta a note thanking
C
him for "the commitment you made to me during our
October 12 meeting in which you assured me that your
D
Office would not ... contact any of the identified
E
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants
I
and their respective counsel in Fthis matter."
I
Marra quoted an equallyT pleasant note then-Palm Beach
County State AttornRey Barry Krischer sent to Assistant U.S.
Attorney Marie EVillafana, who was the lead prosecutor in
Epstein's case. "Glad we could get this worked out for
C
reasons I won't put in writing," Krischer wrote, shortly
A
after the non-prosecution agreement was signed. "After this
is re solved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and
T
have a conversation."
O
NMany of the notes that were exchanged dealt with
prosecutors' and Epstein's lawyers' shared desire to keep the
deal secret from Epstein's accusers. In a September email,
Villafana asked Lefkowitz for guidance about what she
should reveal. "And can we have a conference call to discuss
what I may disclose to ... the girls regarding the
Agreement," she asked.
Such cooperation between prosecutors and defense
attorneys is unusual, Marra said. "It was a deviation from
the government's standard practice to negotiate with
defense counsel about the extent of crime victim
notifications," he wrote.
Further, he noted, that when Edwards and his two young
clients asked for information, they were repeatedly misled.

Epstein indicted on sex charges

Part-time Palm Beacher pleads not guilty to sex

trafficking, conspiracy charges in federal court in
O
Manhattan
C
Dressed in a blue prison jumpsuit, billionaire Jeffrey EpstDein on Monday pleaded not guilty
to charges accusing him of creating a vast network of girls as young as 14 that he exploited
E
for his sexual pleasure at his homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan.
The 66-year-old money manager's appearance in UI.S. District Court in New York City
capped more than a decade of recriminations byF young women and their attorneys who
claimed Epstein used his money and political influence to avoid federal prosecution.
I
Epstein's attorney Reid Weingarten dismTissed the two-count indictment on sex trafficking
charges as "essentially a do-over" of allegations that landed Epstein in the Palm Beach
R
County Jail for 13 months more than a decade ago.
However, unlike in 2007 when thEen-South Florida U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta agreed to
shelve a 53-page federal indictment after Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state
C
prostitution charges, prosecutors in New York indicated they aren't willing to deal. Acosta is
now U.S. labor secretary.
A
"The alleged behavior shocks the conscience," New York City U.S. Attorney Geoffrey
Berman said at a
morning news cTonference. "And while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, it
is still profoundly important to many of the alleged victims, now young women. They
O
deserve their day in court."
At a dNetention hearing scheduled for Monday, Berman said he will ask a federal judge to
keep Epstein behind bars until he is tried on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to
commit sex trafficking. Epstein paid dozens of young women to give him nude massages
that, for most, led to sex, he said.
If convicted of exploiting dozens of young women, including many Palm Beach County girls
who were students at Royal Palm Beach High School, Epstein faces a maximum 45-year
prison sentence.
Citing Epstein's enormous wealth, his homes in New York, Palm Beach, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, New Mexico and Paris and his ownership of two jets, Berman said there are few
conditions that could keep Epstein from fleeing to a foreign country to evade prosecution.
"We think he's a significant flight risk," Berman said of the man who ferried Britain's Prince
Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and former
President Bill Clinton on his jet, dubbed the Lolita Express.
Berman's hard-line stance was welcomed by young women who for years have been told that
Epstein couldn't be touched because Acosta signed off on the nonprosecution agreement,
promising not to charge Epstein in federal court.
Former Palm Beach County resident Virginia Guiffre, who has accused Epstein ofturning
her into his sex slave and forcing her to have sex with others, including Dershowitz and
Prince Andrew, praised Berman. He showed the case is "being taken in a serioYus way," she
told the Associated Press. Dershowitz has vehemently denied Guiffre's claims.
P
New York prosecutors were able to ignore the controversial nonprosecution agreement
because it contained some significant fine print, said former federal JOudge Paul Cassell, who
for years has fought to get the agreement thrown out. It says only that no charges could be
C
filed against Epstein in South Florida, he said.
Berman agreed. "That agreement only binds, by its terms, only binds the Southern District of
Florida," he said. "The Southern District ofNew York is nDot bound by that agreement and
wasn't a signatory of it."
E
That means the sordid allegations that have been leveled at Epstein for years are now part of
a federal indictment. I
F
Contrary to Epstein's claims, he knew the women who came to his homes in New York and
Palm Beach were minors because they told hiIm their ages, according to the indictment.
Epstein preyed on young girls because heT knew they were "vulnerable to exploitation,"
prosecutors added.
R
As part of a carefully orchestrated sex ring, Epstein or his associates would call girls while
he was in New York so they wouEld be available for sex once he returned to Palm Beach, the
indictment says. The employees weren't named. They were identified only as "Employee-I,"
C
"Employee-2" and "Employee-3."
To ensure he had a steady stream of young girls, Epstein would tum some victims into
A
recruiters. He would pay them to bring new girls to his home on El Brillo Way along the
Intracoastal Waterw ay in Palm Beach or to his palatial townhouse on New York's Upper East
T
Side.
"This allowOed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims," Berman said.
In both New York and Palm Beach, the lurid operation was similar. Unidentified employees
of EpsNtein's would escort the teens into a room. They were told to take off all or most of their
clothes before giving the naked billionaire massages, according to the indictment.
"Epstein would also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims to touch him
while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys," the
indictment says.
As part of the criminal complaint, prosecutors are asking that Epstein be forced to turn over
his multimillion-dollar townhouse on East 71 st Street. The complaint does not seek forfeiture
of Epstein's house in Palm Beach.
While heartened that Epstein now faces serious criminal charges in New York, Cassell said
he would continue to push a West Palm Beach-based federal judge to throw out the
nonprosecution agreement that Acosta forged with Epstein's star-studded legal team.
U.S. District Judge Kenenth Marra has already ruled that Acosta violated the federal Crime
Victims' Rights Act by not telling Epstein's victims about the agreement before it was inked.
Coincidentally, Cassell and Epstein attorney Roy Black had to file papers by midnight
Monday, explaining what action Marra should take to redress that wrong.
Cassell insisted Epstein should face charges in federal court in West Palm Beach. "Florida
victims deserve justice in Florida," said Cassell, who is working on behalf of Epstein's
victims with attorneys Bradley Edwards and Jack Scarola.
Since it's likely Florida women will get to testify against Epstein in New York, Scarola said
he's not focused on whether Epstein will face charges here. Instead, he said heY wants to know
how and why the agreement was reached.
P
"There's been no explanation as to how a deal like this could have been cut and how the
federal government could have been involved in a conspiracy to violaOte federal law," Scarola
said of his interest in continuing the legal battle over the nonprosecution agreement.
C
When Acosta agreed to drop the federal investigation, Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to two
prostitution charges and served 13 months of an 18-month sent ence in a vacant wing of the
D
Palm Beach County Jail - a cell he was allowed to leave 12 hours a day, six days a week. He
was also forced to register as a sex offender and settle civil lawsuits more than 30 young
E
women filed against him.
U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, said sIhe shares Scarola's interest in finding out
F
how the agreement came to be. "I am especially more interested in why Epstein got the deal
he got," Frankel said. "We need to know whyI he was given such an easy sentence.
T
While she has asked the House Oversight Committee to investigate Acosta, Frankel said she
is not sure that will happen. "It just sReems to me it was a travesty that this guy got off the
way he did and, without pre-judging it, let's have a proper court case," Frankel said.
E
Former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter was inflamed in 2006 when then-State
Attorney Barry Krischer refuCsed to charge Epstein with serious crimes. Reiter took the
information his officers had gathered from dozens of Epstein's victims to Acosta, believing
he would prosecute Epstein. He didn't.
A
Reiter said he was heartened that 13 years later, Epstein will finally face justice.
"Thankfully, U. S. A ttorney Berman and the other authorities in New York have the good
T
judgment to investigate and prosecute Epstein in the way that should have occurred in
Florida oveOr a decade ago," Reiter said in a statement.
And, Scarola said, there are signals that Berman's investigation is far from over.
N
Berman declined to answer questions about whether others, such as Epstein's high-powered
friends, would be charged. He brushed off questions about the significance that the
investigation was being handled by the Public Corruption Unit.
While agents on Saturday were arresting Epstein aboard his private jet at the Teterboro
Airport in New Jersey after returning from Paris, other officers were searching his New York
City townhouse. Agents seized nude photos of young girls who appeared to be minors,
Berman said.
He said his focus was on finding more women who were exploited and abused by Epstein.
Turning to a poster, detailing the charges that had been filed against Epstein, he pointed a
finger at a photo of the convicted sex offender who was once described as "a man of
mystery."
"If you believe you are a victim of this man, Jeffrey Epstein, we want to hear from you,"
Berman said. A special number, 1-800-CALLFBI, will link victims of authorities.
Bill Sweeney, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, said after years of being
ignored by federal agents, the victims' voices will be heard.
"The Jeffrey Epstein matter is No. 1 on the major case list in the country," Sweeney said.
Turning to address Epstein's victims directly, he said: "Your bravery may empower others to
speak out against crimes against them."
