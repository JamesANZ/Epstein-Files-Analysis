DEFENDANT .JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS JANE DOE NOS.
101 and 102's MOTION FOR AN ORDER FOR THE PRESERVATION OF
EVIDENCE & INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW (dated 5/26/09, DE 114)
Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, ("EPSTEIN"), by and through his undersigned
attorneys responds to the Plaintiffs' Jane Doe No. 101 and Jane Doe No. 102 ("Plaintiffs")
Motion For And Order For The Preservation Of Evidence And Incorporated Memorandum Of
Law, [DE 114], and states:
1. Plaintiffs once again mislead and mischaracterize the criminal counts to which
EPSTEIN pied guilty. Contrary to Plaintiffs' representations in 'l[l of their motion and in their
memorandum of law, EPSTEIN pied guilty to one count of felony solicitation (which was not
related to a minor), under §796.07(2)(f), Fla.Stat., and one count of procuring a minor for
prostitution under §796.03, Fla. Stat. Plaintiffs' reference to the "pleas of 'guilty' ... to various
Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for the prostitution and procurement of
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 151 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 4 of 11
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page4
minors for the purposes of prostitution" mischaracterizes the specific counts to which EPSTEIN
pied guilty.
2. As to Plaintiffs' allegations in 'll'll 2 and 3, many of the Plaintiffs' allegations are
without any factual basis and know such assertions to be false and untrue.
3. Defendant agrees with Plaintiff's assertion that the Palm Beach Police
Department (PBPD) executed a search warrant at EPSTEIN's Palm Beach mansion on October
25, 2005. See '1!4 Plaintiffs' motion.
4. Defendant's attorneys have no objection to an order to preserve evidence similar
to the one entered in the case of Doe v. Epstein, et al, Case No. 08-80804-CIV-
MARRNJOHNSON, [DE 20], and attached hereto as Exhibit A. EPSTEIN's attorneys are
unaware of any items referenced in Plaintiffs' motion, '1!5-6, having been returned to EPSTEIN or
his attorneys, but will agree to a preservation of such items to the extent such items exist.
5. As to '1!7 of Plaintiffs' motion, EPSTEIN and his attorneys have no objection to
the referenced authorities, (PBPD, FBI, USAO, and PBSAO), preserving items to the extent such
items even exist, in a manner that said authorities deem appropriate.
6. As to 'll'l!8, 9, and 10 of Plaintiffs' motion re: documents, Defendant has asserted
in other matters and asserts here, specific legal objections as well as his U.S. constitutional
privileges, as follows: My attorneys have counseled me that at the present time I cannot select,
authenticate, and produce documents relevant to this lawsuit and I must accept this advice or risk
losing my Sixth Amendment right to effective representation. Accordingly, I assert my federal
constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments as guaranteed by the
United States Constitution. Drawing an adverse inference under these circumstances would
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 151 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 5 of 11
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page5
unconstitutionally burden my exercise of my constitutional rights, would be unreasonable, and
would therefore violate the Constitution. In addition to and without waiving his constitutional
privileges, the information sought is privileged and confidential, and inadmissible pursuant to the
terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, Fed. Rule of Evidence 410 and 408, and §90.410,
Fla. Stat. Further Defendants objects as the request to preserve evidence is overly broad and
includes information that is neither relevant to the subject matter of the pending action nor does
it appear to be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
7. Responding to the grossly overly broad list and categories of documents and items
alleged in Plaintiff's motion ('1['1[8-10) involves a testimonial component. The Fifth Amendment
Privilege extends to the act of production where, as here, it involves a self-incriminating
testimonial communication or "a compelled testimonial aspect." United States v. Hubbell, 530
U.S. 27, 120 S.Ct. 2037 (2000); Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976); McCormick on
th
Evidence, Title 6, Chap. 13. The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, §138 (6 Ed.). See also
Malloy v. Hogan, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1495 (1964)(the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause
applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - "[i]t would
be incongruous to have different standards determine the validity of a claim of privilege based on
the same feared prosecution, depending on whether the claim was asserted in state or federal
court."); Hoffman v. U.S., 71 S.Ct. 814,818 (1951), and progeny).
The Fifth Amendment Privilege may be invoked in a civil action where a litigant or
witness is being asked to provide information or respond to a question that may incriminate him
th
in a crime. See generally, DeLisi v. Bankers Ins. Company, 436 So.2d 1099 (Fla. 4 DCA
1983). The privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted during discovery when a litigant
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 151 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 6 of 11
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page6
has "reasonable grounds to believe that the response would furnish a link in the chain of
evidence needed to prove a crime against a litigant." A witness, including a civil defendant, is
entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege whenever there is a realistic possibility that the
answer to a question could be used in anyway to convict the witness of a crime or could aid in
the development of other incriminating evidence that can be used at trial. Id; Pillsbury Company
v. Conboy, 495 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 608 (1983).
The United States Supreme Court has made clear that the scope of the Fifth Amendment
Privilege includes the circumstances as here "the act of producing documents in response to a
subpoena (or production request) has a compelled testimonial aspect." United States v. Hubbell,
530 U.S. 27, 36, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 2043 (2000). In explaining the application of the privilege, the
Supreme Court stated:
We have held that "the act of production" itself may implicitly communicate
"statements of fact." By "producing documents in compliance with a subpoena, the
witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession or control, and
were authentic."FN19 Moreover, as was true in this case, when the custodian of
documents responds to a subpoena, he may be compelled to take the witness stand and
answer questions designed to determine whether he has produced everything
demanded by the subpoena. FNZO The answers to those questions, as well as the act of
production itself, may certainly communicate information about the existence,
custody, and authenticity of the documents. Whether the constitutional privilege
protects the answers to such questions, or protects the act of production itself, is a
question that is distinct from the question whether the unprotected contents of the
documents themselves are incriminating.
FN19. ''The issue presented in those cases was whether the act of producing
subpoenaed documents, not itself the making of a statement, might nonetheless
have some protected testimonial aspects. The Court concluded that the act of
production could constitute protected testimonial communication because it might
entail implicit statements of fact: by producing documents in compliance with a
subpoena, the witness would admit that the papers existed, were in his possession
or control, and were authentic. United States v. Doe. 465 U.S., at 613, and n. 11,
104 S.Ct. 1237; Fisher, 425 U.S., at 409-410, 96 S.Ct. 1569; id., at 428, 432, 96
S.Ct. 1569 (concurring opinions). See Braswell v. United States, (487 U.S.,] at
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 151 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 7 of 11
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page7
104, 108 S.Ct. 2284; ( id.,] at 122, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (dissenting opinion). Thus, the
Court made clear that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination
applies to acts that imply assertions of fact." ... An examination of the Court"s
application of these principles in other cases indicates the Court's recognition that,
in order to be testimonial, an accused's communication must itself, explicitly or
implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information. Only then is a person
compelled to be a 'witness' against himself." Doe v. United States, 487 U.S., at
209-210, 108 S.Ct. 2341 (footnote omitted).
FN20. See App. 62-70. Thus, for example, after respondent had been duly sworn
by the grand jury foreman, the prosecutor called his attention to paragraph A of
the Subpoena Rider (reproduced in the Appendix, infra, at 2048-2049) and asked
whether he had produced "all those documents." App. 65.
Finally, the phrase "in any criminal case" in the text of the Fifth Amendment might
have been read to limit its coverage to compelled testimony that is used against the
defendant in the trial itself. It has, however, long been settled that its protection
encompasses compelled statements that lead to the discovery of incriminating
evidence even though the statements themselves are not incriminating and are not
introduced into evidence. Thus, a half century ago we held that a trial judge had
erroneously rejected a defendant's claim of privilege on the ground that his answer to
the pending question would not itself constitute evidence of the charged offense. As
we explained:
"The privilege afforded not only extends to answers that would in themselves
support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those
which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant
for a federal crime." Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95
L.Ed. 1118 0951).
Compelled testimony that communicates information that may "lead to
incriminating evidence" is privileged even if the information itself is not inculpatory.
Doe v. United States, 487 U.S. 201, 208, n. 6, 108 S.Ct. 2341, 101 L.Ed.2d 184
(1988). It's the Fifth Amendment's protection against the prosecutor's use of
incriminating information derived directly or indirectly from the compelled testimony
of the respondent that is of primary relevance in this case.
In summarizing its holding regarding the application of the Fifth Amendment Privilege to
a production request, the Hubbell Court left "no doubt that the constitutional privilege against
self incrimination protects" not only "the target of a grand jury investigation from being
compelled to answer questions designed to elicit information about the existence of sources of
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 151 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/10/2009 Page 8 of 11
Doe 101 v. Epstein
Page8
potentially incriminating evidence," but the privilege also "has the same application to the
testimonial aspect of a response to a subpoena seeking discovery of those sources." At 43, and
2047. Here, Plaintiffs' motion to preserve evidence by listing a large inventory of items is in
reality no different that propounding a discovery request upon Defendant, and thus, Defendant is
afforded the protection of the Constitutional privileges asserted herein.
8. As stated above, Defendant and Defendant's attorneys have no objection to the
entry of an order similar to Exhibit A hereto.
WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that the Court enter an order similar to that as entered
in Exhibit A hereto.
