Re: Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Koeltl:
Plaintiff Jane Doe hereby responds to the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order
("Opinion") dated March 8, 2021 (ECF 98). As the Court indicated in its Opinion, Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell refused to sign the proposed stipulation to dismiss this action with prejudice
following Plaintiff's acceptance of the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program's offer of
compensation1. Plaintiff was then compelled to file her motion to dismiss with prejudice
pursuant to FRCP Rule 41(a)(2).
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in the case of Paysys Int’l, Inc. v. Atos
IT Servs. Ltd., 901 F.3d 105, 108 (2d Cir. 2018), as cited to by this Court in its Opinion, states
that once the district court articulates its terms for dismissal, “plaintiff . . . has the choice
between accepting the conditions and obtaining dismissal and, if [the plaintiff] feels that the
conditions are too burdensome, withdrawing [the plaintiff’s] dismissal motion and proceeding
with the case on the merits.” Paysys, 901 F.3d at 109 (emphasis added). Indeed, that was the
recent choice Judge Schofield gave another Epstein/Maxwell sex abuse victim plaintiff in the
case of Farmer v. Indyke et al., 19-cv10475-LGS-DCF, following a nearly identical motion to
dismiss filed by the plaintiff after Ms. Maxwell refused to stipulate to a dismissal in that case as
well. In her Opinion and Order, Judge Schofield stated that:
"Plaintiff shall file a letter no later than February 12, 2021, stating
whether she consents to the Court’s entry of the Proposed Order
modified by striking the language “with each party to bear its own
1 Defendant Maxwell is a willing and compulsory "Releasee" in the general release
agreement executed by Plaintiff in connection to this action.

attorneys’ fees and costs,” or wishes to withdraw her motion for
voluntary dismissal." (19-cv-10475, ECF 118).
Neither Second Circuit authority nor Judge Schofield's recent Opinion and Order
regarding the exact issue now before this Court empower defendants to prevent the plaintiff from
dismissing her own case by not agreeing to additional conditions proposed by the Court in
response to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2). Accordingly, by vesting
Defendant Maxwell, who already once refused to agree to a dismissal with prejudice, with such
control and influence over whether Plaintiff may dismiss her own case, the Court's Opinion may
lead to inconsistent results and, if the case is not dismissed, will cause significant and undue
prejudice to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff agrees to and accepts the additional conditions regarding the dismissal specified
by the Court in its March 8, 2021 Memorandum Opinion and Order. Accordingly, and pursuant
to the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter the dismissal of her
case forthwith regardless of whether defendants intend to agree or not to the Court's additional
conditions.
Respectfully submitted,
