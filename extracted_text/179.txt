PER CURIAM.
CA Florida Holdings, LLC, the publisher of the Palm Beach Post (“the
Post”), appeals a final judgment denying the Post’s request for access to
the grand jury proceedings involving the late Jeffrey Epstein. The Post
argues the final judgment should be reversed for three reasons: (1) section
905.27, Florida Statutes (2019), provides a private right of action for
disclosure of grand jury materials; (2) the circuit court has the inherent
power to regulate the use of grand juries; and (3) grand jury secrecy is not
absolute. We agree with the Post in part, and reverse and remand the
case.
• The Trial Court Proceedings
The Post filed a complaint against the state attorney and the clerk,
requesting disclosure of the grand jury materials under section 905.27,
Y
Florida Statutes (2019). Both defendants moved to dismiss. In response,
the Post filed an amended complaint, adding a count for declaratory relief.
P
Both defendants answered the amended complaint asO to the declaratory
relief count and moved to dismiss the count requesting grand jury
C
materials under section 905.27. The state attorney denied “possession
and/or control of documents.” The clerk admitted it “[was] in possession
and/or control of documents.” D
E
The Chief Judge of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit heard the motions to
dismiss. The Chief Judge stated: “I donI’t think anybody is saying that
there isn’t a cause of action [underF section 905.27] or that the press
doesn’t have standing.” Counsel foIr both the clerk and state attorney
indicated they did not seek to “blTock access” to the records. The trial court
granted the motions to dismiss, ruling section 905.27 did not provide a
R
private cause of action.
E
Specifically, the order stated: “[T]he [c]ourt does not suggest The Post
C
has no available mechanism to obtain a court order granting it access to
the grand jury proc eedings. The [c]ourt also does not render any opinion
A
as to whether releasing these records is appropriate for the purpose of
‘furthering justice’ within the meaning of section 905.27.” The Post
dropped thTe state attorney as a defendant. The clerk remained a nominal
defendant as the records custodian.
O
The Post moved for summary judgment, asserting the grand jury
N
materials should be released under the First Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution in conjunction with section 905.27, which allows for the
release of grand jury materials “in . . . furtherance of justice.” The Post
also argued the trial court had inherent authority over the grand jury to
order the disclosure. Prior to the hearing, the clerk filed an extensive
opposition, citing Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial
Administration 2.420. The Post filed a reply. The clerk did not cross-move
for summary judgment.
The then-assigned trial court held a hearing and ultimately issued a
final judgment dismissing the Post’s complaint, finding the court’s
2
inherent authority was constrained by section 905.27. Further, the trial
court found it had “limited authority to order the release of grand jury
records” regardless of “how palatable and persuasive [the Post’s]
arguments may be.”
Rather than evaluate the Post’s motion for summary judgment under
section 905.27, the trial court ruled “the proper procedure for obtaining
disclosure of confidential court records is set forth in FloridYa Rule of
General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.420(j).” The trial court
P
found its “inherent authority” did not “permit it to broaden” section
905.27’s purported limits. The trial court interpreted theO statute to require
a pending civil or criminal action in which the movant is a party before the
C
“in furtherance of justice” provision could be invoked.
The trial court agreed “the established Dmatters surrounding Mr.
Epstein’s conduct, the circumstances of his resolution of the 2006 state
E
charges and potential federal charges, and his 2008 guilty plea and
incarceration are matters of public interesIt, and disclosure of the Materials
may arguably fall within the concept oFf ‘furthering justice’ in the broadest,
social sense of the phrase.” I
T
From this order, the Post appeals and reiterates its trial court
R
arguments. The clerk maintains a neutral position.1 No one opposes the
requested disclosure. E
C
• Standard of Review
A
We review de novo a final summary judgment. Cleveland v. Westport
Recovery Corp., 331 So. 3d 728, 730 (Fla. 4th DCA 2021).
T
• Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial
O
Administration 2.420
N
At the outset we hold the trial court’s reliance on Florida Rule of
General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.420 was misplaced. First,
the Post did not request the materials pursuant to rule 2.420. That rule
was simply not raised in the pleadings. And second, the clerk, who
injected rule 2.420 into the proceedings, advised this court in oral
argument that the rule is inapplicable because this case does not involve
an ongoing criminal or civil matter.
1 The Post, the circuit court clerk, and this Court all agree the only reason for the
clerk’s continued participation is solely as custodian of the grand jury materials.
3
In short, the trial court erred in analyzing the disclosure issue under
rule 2.420. This alone requires reversal and remand for an analysis under
section 905.27.
• Section 905.27
“There is a tradition in the United States, a tradition that is ‘older than
Y
our Nation itself,’ that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally
remain secret.” In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 101 (2d Cir. 1997)
P
(citations omitted).
O
The rule of secrecy, however, is not without exceptions. Those
C
exceptions have developed historically alongside the secrecy
tradition and, more recently, in the practi ce of the federal
courts. They also are codified in [FedeDral Rule of Criminal
Procedure 6(e)(3)]. By this rule, district courts, as part of their
E
supervisory authority over the grand juries that they have
empaneled, are explicitly given thIe discretion to determine
whether, if one or more of the lFisted exceptions to grand jury
secrecy apply, disclosure of reIcords is appropriate.
T
. . . [T]his court has recognized that there are certain ‘special
R
circumstances’ in which release of grand jury records is
appropriate even oEutside of the boundaries of the rule.
C
Id. at 102 (citations omitted).
A
In Craig, the Second Circuit held the district court had authority to
release grand jury materials based on special circumstances that went
beyondT the six exceptions listed in Rule 6. Similarly, in In re
Hastings, 735 F.2d 1261, 1268–69 (11th Cir. 1984), the Eleventh
O
Circuit affirmed the district court’s disclosure of grand jury proceedings
even though not specifically authorized by Rule 6. And the U.S.
N
Supreme Court has held section 905.27 cannot prevent a grand jury
witness from disclosing his/her own testimony because it would violate
the witness’s First Amendment rights. Butterworth v. Smith, 494 U.S.
624 (1990).
We extract from these decisions the court’s inherent authority to
disclose grand jury materials despite the traditional rule of secrecy. In
fact, this is contemplated and supported by section 905.27’s language.
Craig also provides helpful instruction on what a trial court should
consider when faced with this issue.
4
Mindful that there is no talismanic formula or rigid set of
prerequisites, we offer the following non-exhaustive list of
factors that a trial court might want to consider when
confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive
‘special circumstances’ motions: (i) the identity of the party
seeking disclosure; (ii) whether the defendant to the grand
jury proceeding or the government opposes the disclosureY; (iii)
why disclosure is being sought in the particular case; (iv) what
P
specific information is being sought for disclosure; (v) how
long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi)O the current
status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that
C
of their families; (vii) the extent to which the desired material—
either permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously
made public; (viii) whether witnessesD to the grand jury
proceedings who might be affected by disclosure are still alive;
E
and (ix) the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the
particular case in question. I
F
Craig, 131 F. 3d at 106. I
T
With this foundation, we begin our analysis of section 905.27. That
R
statute’s pertinent subsections provide:
E
(1) A grand juror, state attorney, assistant state attorney,
C
reporter, stenographer, interpreter, or any other person
appearing be fore the grand jury shall not disclose the
A
testimony of a witness examined before the grand jury or other
evidence received by it except when required by a court to
discTlose the testimony for the purpose of:
O
(a) Ascertaining whether it is consistent with the testimony
given by the witness before the court;
N
(b) Determining whether the witness is guilty of perjury; or
(c) Furthering justice.
(2) It is unlawful for any person knowingly to publish,
broadcast, disclose, divulge, or communicate to any other
person, or knowingly to cause or permit to be published,
broadcast, disclosed, divulged, or communicated to any other
person, in any manner whatsoever, any testimony of a witness
examined before the grand jury, or the content, gist, or import
5
thereof, except when such testimony is or has been disclosed
in a court proceeding. When a court orders the disclosure of
such testimony pursuant to subsection (1) for use in a
criminal case, it may be disclosed to the prosecuting attorney
of the court in which such criminal case is pending, and by
the prosecuting attorney to his or her assistants, legal
associates, and employees, and to the defendant and the
defendant’s attorney, and by the latter to his or her Ylegal
associates and employees. When such disclosure is ordered
P
by a court pursuant to subsection (1) for use in a civil case, it
may be disclosed to all parties to the case aOnd to their
attorneys and by the latter to their legal associates and
C
employees. However, the grand jury testimony afforded such
persons by the court can only be used in the defense or
prosecution of the civil or criminal caDse and for no other
purpose whatsoever.
E
§ 905.27, Fla. Stat. (2019). I
F
We disagree with the trial court’sI restrictive reading of section 905.27.
We read subsection (1) to prohibTit identified people from disclosing grand
jury witness testimony and evidence, unless required to be disclosed by a
R
court. The statute articulates three exceptions to the prohibition. Its very
language contemplates thEe trial court’s ability to order disclosure: “except
when required by a court to disclose . . . .” § 905.27(1), Fla. Stat. (2019).
C
Although section 905.27 addresses grand jury proceeding secrecy and
A
non-disclosure, it also specifically recognizes a court’s inherent authority
to order disclosure. Here, the Post requested disclosure to further justice
in this higTh-profile criminal investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The
Post did so by tracing the investigation’s controversial history and ultimate
O
disposition of the charges against him. The trial court was required
therefore to determine whether the disclosure will in fact further justice
N
under section 905.27.
Courts have inherent authority to “do all things that are reasonably
necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its
jurisdiction, subject to existing laws and constitutional provisions.” Rose
v. Palm Beach County, 361 So. 2d 135, 137 (Fla. 1978). Here, the trial
court did not exercise its inherent authority as contemplated by section
905.27(1).
Yet, we do know the trial court has already noted:
6
[T]he established matters surrounding [Epstein’s] conduct,
the circumstances of his resolution of the 2006 state charges
and potential federal changes, and his 2008 guilty plea and
incarceration are matters of public interest, and disclosure of
the Materials may arguably fall within the concept of
“furthering justice” in the broadest, social sense of the phrase.
. . . .
Y
It may well be that the disclosure of [Epstein’s] grand jury
P
records could reveal that fair treatment did not occur and that
[Epstein] might have escaped appropriate pOunishment
through some failing of our justice system.
C
We are not unmindful of section 905.27’s subsection (2), which the trial
court read to limit any disclosure under suDbsection (1). But we also
disagree with the trial court’s reading of subsection (2).
E
We read subsection (2) to accomplishI two things. First, it prohibits
disclosure by others than those listedF in subsection (1) unless disclosure
has been ordered. And second, it diIrects to whom disclosure can be made
in pending criminal and civil proTceedings.
R
For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand the case for further
proceedings consistent wEith this opinion. Upon remand, the trial court
shall conduct an in-camera inspection of the material sought and using
C
the guidance provided by Craig, decide whether the material’s disclosure
furthers justice. If s o, the court has the inherent authority to disclose any
A
material that furthers justice. In doing so, the trial court shall take steps
necessary to protect the identity of the victims, witnesses, and those who
have not bTeen criminally charged. If the court determines disclosure of
any of the material will not further justice, the court can, in its discretion,
O
deny disclosure of that material.
N
Because our decision could have far-reaching consequences, we certify
the following question to be of great public importance:
DOES A CIRCUIT COURT HAVE INHERENT AUTHORITY TO
DISCLOSE GRAND JURY EVIDENCE TO FURTHER JUSTICE
UNDER SECTION 905.27?
Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
MAY, J., concurs.
CIKLIN, J., concurs specially with opinion.
7
KUNTZ, J., concurs specially with opinion.
CIKLIN, J., concurring specially.
I write to concur with the majority opinion insofar as it instructs the
circuit court to forthwith implement a procedure necessary to provide a
means for the circuit court to review the Palm Beach Post’s request for
access to the subject grand jury proceedings. But contrary to thYe majority
opinion, I tend to agree with both the circuit court and the clerk of the
P
circuit court that section 905.27, Florida Statutes (2019), has no bearing
on the issue before us. Specifically, section 905.27 proOvides very narrow
substantive rights to those indicted for crimes to obtain grand/jury
C
materials for use in their civil and criminal cases. § 905.27(1)-(2), Fla. Stat.
(2019). Like Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration
2.420, section 905.27 assumes an ongoing civDil or criminal case, and that
is not the posture of this case, rendering both provisions equally
E
inapplicable.
I
But—under the jurisprudence of Fthis state—that does not end our
inquiry because the Florida judiciarIy has inherent authority over all of its
grand jury records and does Tnot need legislative authority to do its
business.
R
Florida’s judicial syEstem and all Florida grand juries enjoy an
inseparable relationship that goes back more than 120 years. The Florida
C
Supreme Court has described it as a “blood kinship.” In re Grand Jury
Investigation, 287 S o. 2d 43, 46 (Fla. 1973).
A
Because Florida grand juries are an integral part of the Florida judicial
system, I Twould hold that under the Florida Constitution, the Florida
judiciary has the inherent power, authority, and control over all Florida
O
grand jury proceedings—which are indisputably court proceedings—
including the release of its records and materials. Subject to the
N
rulemaking power of the Florida Supreme Court, this inherent authority
includes the overall regulation and control of all grand juries as integral to
“a judicial proceeding in a court of justice . . . an appendage or adjunct to
the circuit court.” In re Grand Jury, 287 So. 2d at 46 (quoting Craft v.
State, 29 So. 418, 419 (Fla. 1900)).
I also concur with my colleagues’ decision to certify the question of great
public importance raised in this case to the Florida Supreme Court. The
question of a circuit court’s inherent authority to order disclosure of grand
jury records is a matter of first impression. See Duggan v. Tomlinson, 174
So. 2d 393, 393 (Fla. 1965) (recognizing that, pursuant to provisions of the
8
Florida Constitution, the Florida Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review
any decision of a district court of appeal that passes upon a question of
great public interest, especially as to “decisions . . . of first impression”).
Additionally, our decision could have far-reaching consequences, as it has
the potential of resulting in numerous requests by the press or the public
for disclosure of grand jury records. See Young v. State, 678 So. 2d 427,
429 (Fla. 4th DCA 1996) (certifying a question of great public importance
where the issue “arises frequently and affects numerousY criminal
defendants within this district and throughout the state”). Thus, I too
P
would certify a question of great public importance but would slightly
broaden it as follows: O
C
WHAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, IF ANY, SHOULD BE
ENACTED UNDER THE RULE-MAKING AUTHORITY OF THE
FLORIDA SUPREME COURT OR THE ADUTHORITY VESTED
TO THE CIRCUIT COURTS BY THE FLORIDA SUPREME
E
COURT TO PROPERLY CONSIDER AND DECIDE A REQUEST
TO DISCLOSE PORTIONS OF IFLORIDA GRAND JURY
RECORDS? F
I
KUNTZ, J., concurring specially. T
R
I agree that the circuit court erred when it relied on Rule 2.420 to deny
the appellant’s request Eto unseal the grand jury records, particularly
because the operative pleading did not ask the court to do so. I also agree
C
that controlling authority gives a circuit judge discretion to order the
release of grand jur y materials when justice requires. So I concur in the
A
court’s opinion.
I do so Teven though, generally, “[t]he proceedings of a grand jury are to
be kept secret.” Clein v. State, 52 So. 2d 117, 120 (Fla. 1950). For that
O
reason, the legislature “closed” grand jury proceedings to the public. Palm
Beach Newspapers, Inc. v. Burk, 471 So. 2d 571, 582–83 n.9 (Fla. 4th DCA
N
1985) (C.J., Anstead, dissenting); see also Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc. v.
Doe, 460 So. 2d 406, 408 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984). The legislature also created
a system to peer into these secret proceedings when certain conditions are
satisfied. Minton v. State, 113 So. 2d 361, 363 (Fla. 1959) (referencing
section 905.27, Florida Statutes).
This Court has agreed that section 905.27 governs the release of grand
jury materials. See Barber v. Interim Rep. of the Grand Jury Spring Term
1995, 689 So. 2d 1182, 1185 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997); James v. Wille, 480 So.
2d 253, 254 (Fla. 4th DCA 1985). Our sister courts and the Florida
Supreme Court reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., Minton, 113 So.
9
2d at 363; Tallahassee Democrat, Inc. v. O’Grady, 421 So. 2d 58, 59 (Fla.
1st DCA 1982); Jackman v. State, 140 So. 2d 627, 629 (Fla. 3d DCA 1962).
Those cases hold that section 905.27 allows the release of grand jury
materials in the furtherance of justice. See also Keen v. State, 639 So. 2d
597, 600 (Fla. 1994); Minton, 113 So. 2d at 363; State ex rel. Brown v.
Dewell, 167 So. 687, 689 (Fla. 1936); James, 480 So. 2d at 254; State v.
Gillespie, 227 So. 2d 550, 559 (Fla. 2d DCA 1969); State v. DrYayton, 226
So. 2d 469, 474–75 (Fla. 2d DCA 1969).
P
Notwithstanding those cases, it is unclear whether Othe actual text of
the statute allows release of grand jury materials outside of a civil or
C
criminal case. See § 905.27, Fla. Stat. The statute’s text allows disclosure
in limited situations and to limited persons, and only when a court orders
disclosure of the material. Id. There are Dthree exceptions. Section
905.27(1)(a) allows the named persons to disclose grand jury testimony
E
when ordered by a court to do so for the purpose of “[a]scertaining whether
it is consistent with the testimony given Iby the witness before the court.”
Section 905.27(1)(b) allows a court Fto order disclosure of grand jury
testimony when necessary to determIine “whether the witness is guilty of
perjury.” Finally, section 905.2T7(1)(c) states that a court can permit the
disclosure of grand jury testimony when the court determines that
R
disclosure would further justice.
E
Most cases focus on the third exception, disclosure in the furtherance
C
of justice. Section 905.27(2)—which appears to limit the disclosure to
pending civil and c riminal proceedings—is ignored.2 In other cases, the
A
entire statute is ignored. Keen, 639 So. 2d at 600.
Why poTrtions of section 905.27 are ignored is unclear. In a different
context, the Florida Supreme Court noted that the legislature controls the
O
publication of grand jury materials. Miami Herald Publ’g Co. v. Marko, 352
So. 2d 518, 520–21 (Fla. 1977) (“It is undoubtedly for this reason that the
N
legislature has now afforded an opportunity to prevent the publication of
unfavorable material through the repression of matter that is ‘improper
and unlawful.’”). If the legislative system for preventing publication of a
grand jury report controls, why can we disregard the legislature’s system
for releasing grand jury materials? It seems to me that “[t]he legislature
2 It was argued in at least one case that grand jury materials can only be released
in a pending civil or criminal case. State ex rel. Oldham v. Baker, 226 So. 2d 21,
22 (Fla. 3d DCA 1969). The case was resolved on other grounds. Id.
10
has chosen . . . [the system] and it is not our prerogative to select another
alternative.” Id. at 520 n.5.
The language of the statute should control for another reason. The
Florida Constitution provides broad access to public records. But it
includes a provision that any laws or rules of court “in effect on July 1,
1993 that limit public access to records or meetings shall remain in force,
and such laws apply to records of the legislative and judicialY branches,
until they are repealed.” Art. I, § 24(d), Fla. Const. If a class of documents
P
was not made confidential by statute or rule on that date, they would not
be confidential unless later classified as confidential by Oa supermajority of
the legislature. Id. § 24(c). But the legislature had provided for the
C
confidentiality of grand jury proceedings on that date. § 905.24, Fla. Stat.
The statute makes grand jury proceedings confidential, and the statute is
where we should turn to determine the exceptDions. § 905.27, Fla. Stat.
E
In conclusion, controlling authority holds that a court may disclose
grand jury materials under the furtherIing justice provision of section
905.27(1). That compels me to join thFe majority’s opinion and decision to
certify a question to the Florida SupIreme Court. While I join the majority
opinion in full, I do not agree thTat the majority opinion is instructing the
circuit court to implement a procedure to provide a means to review the
R
pending request to access the grand jury materials. We are judges, not
kings, and on a clean slaEte, I would stick to the language of the statute.
