Re: Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as co-
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. We write to
request a four day extension of the deadline for the Co-Executors to respond to Plaintiff’s
Complaint, from today to this Friday. We requested this extension because of difficulties arising
from the COVID-19 outbreak and related lockdown of the tri-state area. Plaintiff consents to this
request. The requested extension will not impact any other deadlines in this action.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Bennet J. Moskowitz
