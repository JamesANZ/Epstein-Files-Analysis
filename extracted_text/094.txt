Re: Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF
Update Regarding Settlement and Plaintiff's Pending Motion to Dismiss
Dear Judge Koeltl:
On October 16, 2020, the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP) made an
offer of compensation to Plaintiff who accepted that offer on November 29, 2020. As the Court
was previously made aware, a condition of payment of the settlement to Plaintiff was that she
had to dismiss this pending action with prejudice. Plaintiff promptly attempted to do so by
securing a stipulation for dismissal among the parties. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell refused to
stipulate. On December 21, 2020, Plaintiff wrote this Court requesting that it dismiss the case
with prejudice pursuant to FRCP 41(a)(2) (ECF 87). In response to that letter, the Court
scheduled a status conference for December 23, 2020. Following the status conference, the
Court set a briefing schedule for Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss. Pursuant to that briefing
schedule, Plaintiff filed her Motion to Dismiss on January 15, 2021 (ECF 91). Her reply brief is
due tomorrow.
Today, however, we received a letter from the EVCP Fund Administrator, Jordy
Feldman, entitled "Important Update Regarding the Epstein VCP." That letter is enclosed for
the Court's reference. Ms. Feldman states, in pertinent part, "I am writing to inform you that, due
to uncertainty about the liquidity of Estate assets to fund the Program, effective immediately, all
compensation determination offers will be held until after the March 25, 2021 claims filing
deadline or until such time that I have sufficient certainty that eligible claims can be timely and
fully funded and paid."
In light of this unanticipated development, Plaintiff is requesting that the Court continue
her Motion to Dismiss and defer its ruling on it until after we know whether or not the settlement
reached among the parties will be honored by the EVCP.

In addition, based on the questionable actions taken by Ms. Maxwell to delay the
settlement by refusing to allow a case against her to be dismissed with prejudice, as well as the
Estate’s insistence that she must be dismissed even though the settlement was to be 100% from
Estate assets, Plaintiff requests that the Court conduct a hearing with all interested parties
(including the EVCP administrator) to determine if there have been any collusive efforts, plans
or intentions by those involved to disenfranchise Plaintiff and the other sex abuse victims of
Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in this litigation.
