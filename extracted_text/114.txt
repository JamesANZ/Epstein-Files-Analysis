DARREN K. INDYKE, ET AL.
Defendants .
JOHN G. KOELTL, District Judge:
Defendant, Ghislane Maxwell, seeks to have her costs in the
amount of $13.70 taxed against the plaintiff because the
plaintiff dismissed this action with prejudice against Ms.
Maxwell. The Clerk declined to tax costs because the plaintiff
disputed whether Ms. Maxwell was a prevailing party. This Court
previously found that Ms . Maxwell was a prevailing party. See
ECF No. 98 at 5. By letter dated June 10, 2021, ECF. No. 113,
counsel for the plaintiff indicated that if the Court is
inclined to grant Ms . Maxwell' s request, the plaintiff will send
the plaintiff the $13.70. Because Ms . Maxwell is the prevailing
party, the plaintiff should pay the costs in the amount of
$13 .70.
SO ORDERED.
Dated: New York, New York
