NOTICES
1. MOTIONS (Fla. R. App. P. 9.300)
• Excessive motion practice is strongly discouraged.
• Any record material supporting a motion shall be contained in an appendix with the motion.
• Motions concerning preparation of the record or brief, extensions of time (see paragraph 2 below), or to
reschedule oral argument, shall contain a certificate that opposing counsel has been consulted and shall
state whether opposing counsel has an objection to the motion. Attempts to contact opposing counsel are
not sufficient.
• Any response to a motion shall be promptly served, and in any case not later than 15 days after service of
the motion.
• Motions for extension of time or to supplement the record may be ruled on without waiting for a response.
• No reply to the response will be considered unless specifically authorized by this Court. Any
unauthorized reply will be stricken without consideration.
2. EXTENSIONS OF TIME
• Limited extensions for briefs can be granted by the Clerk, unless the motion certifies that the opposing party
opposes the motion and the opposing party files a response which contains a valid opposition to the motion.
• The court may limit extensions in any appeal. See paragraph 1 above for motion requirements.
• In lieu of an agreed motion for extension of time to file an initial, answer, or reply brief, the court will
accept a notice from a party that the parties have agreed to a specific extension of time. An agreed notice
will be accepted for up to a total of 90 days for an initial or answer brief, and 15 days for a reply brief. The
notice need not be signed by both parties. No order will issue from the court: please check the docket entry.
This procedure shall not apply to appeals from adoptions, dependency, termination of parental rights,
nonfinal orders, or any expedited or emergency appeal. See Administrative Order No. 2018-1 on the court’s
website for details as to the form of the notice.
• Extension requests beyond the time frames set forth above, whether the prior extensions were by
agreed notice or by order granting an extension, are disfavored and will Ynot be granted absent a
detailed explanation for why the brief was not filed and a showing of extraordinary circumstances.
P
3. SERVICE OF FILINGS (Fla. R. App. P. 9.420)
O
• All filings, e.g., motions, petitions, notices, briefs, appendices, etc., must contain a certificate of service.
All certificates of service, including those on notices of appeal, must contain the name and physical address
C
of the attorney or party served, not just the e-mail address. Certificates of service must comply with Florida
Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516(f).
D
4. STATUS INQUIRIES
E
• Any request for the status of a pending case must be made to the Clerk’s Office and may not be made to a
judge of the court or the personal staff of any judge. Attorneys and parties representing themselves may
I
access case documents and dockets for their own cases via eDCA. Public case dockets for all cases are
F
available online at www.4dca.org.
I
T
5. RELATED CASES – NOTICE OF RELATED CASE
• All parties shall promptly bring to the court’s attention the pendency in this court of any related case, or
R
any case involving related issues.
• In criminal cases where multEiple defendants participated in a joint trial, the parties shall notify the court of
any other appeals, whether pending or concluded, from the same trial.
C
6. TRANSCRIPTS
• All transcripts sAubmitted as part of the record must appear as one page of transcript per page. Four pane
transcripts (four pages of transcript on a page) will be rejected.
7. PHYSICAL EXH T IBITS
• No physical evidence (excluding documents) or outsized exhibits shall be included in the record on appeal
O
without the party first requesting permission of the court. It is the responsibility of the party to ensure that
the lower tribunal clerk has included any relevant documentary evidence introduced at trial in the record
N
on appeal.
8. SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY (Fla. R. App. P. 9.225)
• A copy of the newly discovered authority should be attached to the notice. The notice should also designate
clearly the issue to which the supplemental authority is pertinent. The notice shall not contain argument,
but may identify briefly the issues argued on appeal to which the supplemental authorities are pertinent.
9. ORAL ARGUMENT (Fla. R. App. P. 9.320)
• A request for oral argument shall be a separate filing, clearly designated as such, and shall contain no other
subject. It shall not be made as part of a brief or appendix. The request must contain a specific but brief
reason as to why oral argument is necessary. A request to participate in oral argument through
communication technology must be included within the request for oral argument and must state the
reason why oral argument through communication technology is requested.
• The request for oral argument may contain a designation of 10, 15 or 20 minutes as the amount of time
requested for oral argument. Oral argument for each side shall not exceed 20 minutes.
• At any time before oral argument the court in its discretion may dispense with, limit or expand the time for
oral argument as it deems appropriate to the issues raised.
• Cases without oral argument are subject to the same review, analysis and consideration by a three judge
panel as are cases that are orally argued.
10. SCHEDULING CONFLICTS
• Calendar conflicts shall be resolved in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial
Administration 2.550. “Notices of Unavailability” are unauthorized and will be automatically stricken.
Requests for continuances of oral argument must be based on either a substantial commitment
preexisting the receipt of the oral argument calendar or an emergency situation.
11. REHEARING
• Although motions for rehearing are permitted by Florida Rule of Appellate ProYcedure 9.330, they should
be rare. See Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Reitzes, 631 So. 2d 1100, 1100-01 (Fla. 4th DCA 1993).
• The court strongly discourages the practice of routinely filing such motionPs or the filing of those which
merely re-argue the merits or question the court’s decision. Where there has been an award of attorney’s
O
fees on appeal in connection with our decision on the merits, additional fees will be awarded upon a denial
of a motion for rehearing.
C
12. RIGHTS OF CHILDREN (Fla. R. App. P. 9.146)
• Cases involving adoption, termination of parental rights, aDnd those involving families and children in need
of services are expedited. Consult the rule for the time and procedure requirements. Cases relating to child
E
custody, visitation privileges, or other substantial interests of children will be expedited upon proper
motion.
