On March 19, 2021, this Court dismissed plaintiff’s case with prejudice, based on her
motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2). As the prevailing party in
this matter, Ms. Maxwell hereby requests, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1), an order
awarding her taxable costs against plaintiff Jane Doe.
Rule 54(d)(1) provides that “[u]nless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order
provides otherwise, costs—other than attorney's fees—should be allowed to the prevailing
party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1). “Courts consistently have found defendants to be prevailing
parties where the action against them was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice.” Ctr. for
Discovery, Inc. v. D.P., No. 16-CV-3936-MKB-RER, 2018 WL 1583971, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Mar.
31, 2018); see Beer v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., 211 F.R.D. 67, 70 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (“All
circuit courts to have directly addressed this issue have concluded that a defendant [who has
obtained a voluntary dismissal with prejudice] is a prevailing party, or alternatively, that a
district court has discretion to award costs to the defendant.”); see also Carter v. Inc. Vill. of
Ocean Beach, 759 F.3d 159, 165 (2d Cir. 2014) (disclaiming prior Second Circuit dicta which
stated that “generally the defendant is not considered the prevailing party when, as here, there is
a voluntary dismissal of the action by the plaintiff with prejudice.” (citations omitted)). “A
voluntary dismissal of an action with prejudice [is considered to materially alter the relationship
of the parties], because it constitutes ‘an adjudication on the merits for purposes of res
judicata.’” Carter, 759 F.3d at 165 (citation omitted); accord Feb. 12, 2021, Opinion and Order,
DE 118; accord Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke et. al, Case No. 20-cv-484 (JGK), DE 98 at 5
(addressing identical Rule 41(a)(2) motion and holding “Ms. Maxwell is correct that under
Second Circuit law, she is the prevailing party for the purposes of Rule 54(d)”).

An award of costs under Rule 54 is the “normal rule,” and “the losing party has the
burden to show that costs should not be imposed.” Torcivia v. Suffolk Cty., 437 F. Supp. 3d 239,
249 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (quoting Harris v. Brown, No. 08-CV-1703 MKB, 2013 WL 632247, at *1
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2013). Once “the prevailing party demonstrates the amount of its costs and
that they fall within an allowable category of taxable costs, see Local Rule 54.1(a), that party
enjoys a presumption that its costs will be awarded.” Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v.
United Health Programs of Am., Inc., 350 F. Supp. 3d 199, 236 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting
Patterson v. McCarron, No. 99-cv-11078 (RCC), 2005 WL 735954, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30,
2005).
Annexed hereto is Ms. Maxwell’s Bill of Costs, including the Affidavit of Laura
Menninger and exhibits, in the form required by Local Civil Rule 54.1 and including only those
taxable costs prescribed by the rule.1 As the prevailing party, Ms. Maxwell is presumptively
entitled to an award of cost, and plaintiff is unable to meet her burden to demonstrate why costs
should not be imposed. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court order plaintiff to pay
her costs in the amount detailed in the attached.
WHEREFORE, Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell requests an award of costs pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 54(d)(1) as the prevailing party in this action.
1 Ms. Maxwell seeks herein only her costs and expressly reserves her right to seek
attorneys’ fees incurred in defense of this action in future litigation either against plaintiff (e.g.,
as claims for malicious prosecution or abuse of process), against the Estate of Epstein (under an
indemnification theory), or both. See Opinion and Order of Feb. 10, 2021 at 5 (DE 118); accord
Opinion and Order of Mar. 9, 2021, Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke et. al, 20-cv-484 (JGK), at 5
(Dkt. 98) (striking language from proposed Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal relating to each party paying
their own fees and costs to preserve right to seek attorneys’ fees from this litigation in potential
future litigation for claims including the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution).
