THE MCCLATCHY COMPANY, LLC’S MOTION TO INTERVENE
I
T
The McClatchy Company, LLC (“McClatchy”), publisher of The Miami Herald, moves to
R
intervene in this action for the limited purpose of obtaining, pursuant to §905.27, Florida Statutes,
E
access to grand jury materialsC relating to Jeffrey Epstein. The grounds for this motion are:
1. McClatAchy publishes The Miami Herald. The reporting of McClatchy’s
professional journali sts, especially Julie Brown, have been central and instrumental in exposing
T
Jeffrey EpOstein’s sexual abuse and trafficking of minors. The Miami Herald’s first articles
regardNing Mr. Epstein were published in November 2018.
2. Through an initial and amended complaint, and then the prosecution of an appeal,
Plaintiff has sought to obtain through this action grand jury materials relating to Mr. Epstein.
3. By Agreed Order dated February 28, 2024, the Court permitted the Associated
Press to intervene in this action, writing that “[t]he Associated Press is hereby permitted to
*** FILED: PALM BEACH COUNTY, FL JOSEPH ABRUZZO, CLERK. 03/01/2024 04:41:55 PM ***
intervene in this matter and shall be granted access to any grand jury materials the Court orders to
be disclosed.”
4. Yesterday, on February 29, 2024, this Court entered an order ruling that under the
law, as it existed on that date, releasing the grand jury materials would not further justice and, on
that basis, the Court would not order the release of the materials. However, the Court noted that
Y
the governing law will change on July 1, 2024, and the Court granted the pParties leave to file a
O
motion for reconsideration once the law changes.
C
5. Through this Motion, McClatchy seeks to intervene in this action for the limited
D
purpose of obtaining access to any grand jury materials that, upon motion for reconsideration, the
E
Court orders to be disclosed. As the publisher of a newspaper of general circulation, McClatchy
I
F
has standing to intervene for the purpose of opposing closure of records and seeking to obtain
I
T
access to records. See, e.g., Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113, 118
R
(Fla. 1988); Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Lewis, 426 So.2d 1, 4 (Fla. 1983).
E
WHEREFORE, McClatchy respectfully requests the entry of an Order permitting it to
C
intervene in this action for the limited purpose of obtaining access to the grand jury materials
A
related to Mr. Epstein.
