RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO STRIKE CASE
FROM CURRENT TRIAL DOCKET
COMES NOW plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her undersigned counsel, to file
this response in opposition to defendant Jeffrey Epstein's motion to strike her trial date
from the current trial docket. Epstein argues that a few discovery disputes require
striking the trial date. But these disputes can be resolved before the discovery deadline
expires - particularly given that there are nearly four months remaining until the
discovery cutoff. Moreover, Jane Doe will be gravely harmed by any delay in this matter
because it will give Epstein the opportunity to finish hiding his assets.

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 146 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/08/2009 Page 5 of 11
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
Background
Defendant Epstein has filed a boilerplate motion to strike Jane Doe's trial date -
and numerous other consolidated cases involving similar allegations of his sexual abuse
of minors - for an unspecified period of time, delaying what is currently set as a
February 22, 2010, trial date until some later and unspecified date. On May 28, 2009,
the court granted the motion to strike the trial date as to plaintiffs Jane Does 2-7 - who
had agreed to the delay for their own reasons. The court set a new trial date of June 1,
2010, for these cases. The court, however, reserved ruling on the motion to continue
Jane Doe's case (and one other plaintiff, C.M.A.).
In recounting the procedural history of this case, Epstein does not disclose that in
this particular case, he has been the one responsible for numerous delays. Indeed, a
quick review of the docket sheet shows the following requests for extensions by
defendant Epstein:
DE 10 (defendant's motion for extension of time to respond to complaint)
(10/1/08)
DE21 (defendant's motion for extension of time to file motions to compel) (3/4/09)
DE39 (defendant's motion extension of time to file reply as to response to
opposition to motion to stay) (4/22/09)
DE41 (defendant's motion for extension of time to file reply as to response in
opposition to motion to compel tax records) (4/27/09)
DE42 (defendant's motion for extension of time to file reply as to response in
opposition to motion to compel on first interrogatories) (4/27/09)

CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
DE44 (defendant's motion for extension of time to file response as to motion to
strike reference to non-prosecution agreement) (4/29/09)
DE52 (defendant's motion for extension to time to file response as to amended
complaint) (5/05/09)
DE60 (motion for extension of time to file response to plaintiff's first amended
complaint) (5/18/09)
It should be noted that Jane Doe, as a matter of civility, has not objected to a
single one of these requests for an extension from defendant Epstein. In none of these
conferences regarding these requests for extension did defense counsel indicate that
he was concerned that the trial date might need to be continued because of any delay in
this case.
Jane Doe has yet to request a single extension of time for any reason.
It may also be relevant to note that Epstein has "taken the Fifth" with regard to
essentially all discovery that Jane Doe has propounded to him in this case.
Epstein Has Failed to Provide any "Exceptional Circumstances"
to Continue the Trial Date
This court, of course, has discretion to continue the trial date. The rules of this
court, however, make clear that "[a] continue of any trial ... will be granted only on
exceptional circumstances." Local Rule 7.6 (emphasis added). All defendant Epstein
has shown is a few, run of the mill, discovery disputes - that have arisen months in
advance of the discovery deadline. (The deadline in this case is October 1, 2009 -
roughly four months away.) At the very least, any motion to continue is premature.

CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
Defendant Epstein has failed to provide any good reason for delaying trial in
Jane Doe's case. Most of his pleading focuses on discovery disputes that have arisen
with regard to Jane Does 2-7 or C.M.A. These disputes have absolutely no bearing on
whether Jane Doe's case can be ready for trial by February 22, 2010.
In an effort to provide some sort of "good cause" for rescheduling the trial date,
Epstein's defense counsel has provided an affidavit asserting generally that it will not be
possible to complete discovery in a timely fashion in this case. That same affidavit,
however, acknowledges that some of the discovery disputes that have arisen in other
cases have not arisen in this case. In particular, the affidavit spends a great deal of
time explaining how an objection to disclosing the true names of the plaintiffs in other
cases has (allegedly) made it impossible for Epstein to serve subpoenas and thus
obtain meaningful discovery about other plaintiffs. See Affidavit of Michael J. Pike at 4-
5, Exhibit 1 to Epstein's Motion to Strike Cases from Current Trial Docket. The affidavit
concedes, however, that this objection does not apply to Jane Doe's case. See id. at 5
("As stated in the motion to strike, Brad Edwards [counsel for Jane Doe] has agreed to
such a procedure relative to third party subpoenas.").
In addition, Jane Doe will be gravely prejudiced if a delay of any sort is
sanctioned in this case. As the court is well aware, this case involves serious
allegations of sexual abuse of minor. Each passing day with the matter unresolved
adds to the psychological stress that Jane Doe must bear. This is not the kind of case
that where additional time should be allowed to pass. In general, 'The compensation
and remedy due a civil plaintiff should not be delayed." Gordon v. FDIC, 427 F.2d 578,

CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
580 (D.C. Cir. 1970). Given the sexual abuse allegations at stake here, that general
admonition applies with even greater force.
Moreover, Jane Doe will be gravely prejudiced if Epstein is allowed to postpone
trial in this matter. As explained at greater length in Jane Doe's soon to be filed
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Injunction Restraining Fraudulent Transfer of
Assets, good cause exists for believing defendant Epstein is currently moving his assets
overseas in an attempt to defeat the satisfaction of any judgment that Jane Doe might
obtain in this case. In addition, it is possible that by delaying the trial until June 2010,
Epstein might be able to escape the supervision of the Florida courts entirely. Epstein
is currently in jail and will serve a one-year term of community control (house arrest)
following his release. Conveniently enough for Epstein, it appears that this term of
community control will expire at around the time of his proposed new trial date.
For all these reasons, the Court should deny the motion to strike Jane Doe's
currently-established trial date.
Dated: June 8, 2009.
