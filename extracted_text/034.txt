Re: Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as co-
executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of
Jeffrey E. Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. On March 27,
2020, Judge Koeltl granted the Co-Executors leave to file a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint
(ECF Doc. No. 30). However, the Court did not set a briefing schedule. Accordingly, we write to
request Your Honor’s approval of the parties’ agreed briefing schedule for Defendants’ motion to
dismiss, as follows:
 The Co-Executors shall file their motion to dismiss on or before April 17, 2020;
 Plaintiff shall file her response to the Co-Executors’ motion to dismiss on or before April
27, 2020; and
 The Co-Executors shall file their reply in support of their motion to dismiss on or before
May 11, 2020.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Bennet J. Moskowitz
