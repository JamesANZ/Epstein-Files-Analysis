PLAINTIFF, JANE DOE'S MOTION FOR INJUNCTION RESTRAINING
FRAUDULENT TRANSFER OF ASSETS, APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER TO
TAKE CHARGE OF PROPERTY OF EPSTEIN, AND TO POST A $15 MILLION BOND,
TO SECURE POTENTIAL JUDGMENT
COMES NOW Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through undersigned counsel, and
hereby files this Motion for Injunction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 64,
for appointment of a receiver to take charge of Epstein's property, and to post a $15
million bond to secure any potential judgment in this case, for the reasons explained in
the accompanying supporting memorandum.
Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her undersigned counsel, files this
memorandum in support of her motion for appointment of a receiver to take charge of

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 5 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
Epstein's property and to post a $15 million bond to secure any potential judgment in
this case.
Epstein is a billionaire who recently has been fraudulently transferring his assets
overseas and elsewhere with the intent to prevent Jane Doe (and possibly numerous
other victims of his sexual abuse) from satisfying any judgment they might obtain
against him. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 64 guarantees Jane Doe all available
state law pre-judgment remedies to respond to these fraudulent transfers. Florida has
adopted the Florida Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (FUFTA), Fla. Stat. Ann.§ 726.101
et seq., which gives the Court power to appoint a receiver to take charge of assets that
are being fraudulently transferred. Given the serious allegations of sexual abuse against
Jane Doe when she was a minor, this Court should appoint a receiver to control and
account for Epstein's assets and direct the receiver to post a $15 million bond with this
Court on behalf of Epstein to satisfy any judgment that Jane Doe might obtain.
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS
1. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is the defendant in this action, which involves
claims by Jane Doe that Epstein repeatedly sexually abused her when she was a minor.
Because of the egregious and repeated acts of sexual abuse committed by Epstein, her
complaint seeks damages in excess of $50 million, including punitive damages. See
,r
Amended Complaint, 2.
2. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is extremely wealthy. According to reputable press
reports in the New York Times and elsewhere, he is a billionaire. He is also the owner
5
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 6 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
of a Caribbean island in the Virgin Islands (Little St. James Island), where he serves as
a financial advisor to other billionaires. He was previously a financial trader at Bear
Stearns. It is therefore reasonable to infer that he has a great deal of financial
sophistication. See Affidavit of Paul Cassell at ,r 2 Attachment A to this Pleading.
3. According to reputable press reports, before his recent incarceration
(discussed below), he frequently traveled around the globe in the company of such
famous persons as President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Donald Trump. It is
therefore reasonable to infer that he has international contacts, including international
financial contacts. See Affidavit of Paul Cassell at ,r 3.
4. Over the past year, approximately 25 civil suits have been filed in Florida state
courts and Florida federal courts raising similar allegations of sexual abuse by Jeffrey
Epstein against minor girls. These complaints seek damages comparable to those
sought by Jane Doe in this case. See Affidavit of Paul Cassell at ,r 4. Accordingly,
Epstein has currently pending against him lawsuits seeking more than $1 billion in
damages. He thus faces financial ruin. Id.
5. On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein pied guilty to one count of procuring a
person under 18 for prostitution and one count of felony solicitation to prostitution before
the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida.
He was sentenced to 18 months in jail.
6. Since those guilty pleas, he has been incarcerated in the Palm Beach County
Detention facility. However, he has also been allowed out on a "work release" program,
where he works at managing his financial interests. Affidavit of Paul Cassell at ,r 5.

CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
7. Given the substantial claims against him, his international connections, and
other information, Jane Doe's counsel has been gravely concerned that Epstein will
fraudulently transfer all of his assets to overseas locations to defeat collection of any
judgment that she might obtain against him. Accordingly, as part of discovery in this
case, Jane Doe propounded requests for admissions by Epstein regarding whether he
was fraudulently transferring assets. Rather than answering these requests for
admission about on-going fraudulent transfers of his property, Jeffrey Epstein asserted
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Affidavit of Paul Cassell at ,r 6.
8. Jeffrey Epstein's net worth is greater than $1 billion. Jane Doe's First
Request for Admissions (RFA's) #5, Attachment B to this Pleading; Epstein's Resp. to
RFA's #5, Attachment C to this Pleading.
9. Since he was incarcerated, Jeffrey Epstein has, directly or indirectly (through
the services or assistance of other persons) conveyed money and assets in an attempt
to insulate and protect his money and assets from being captures in civil lawsuits filed
against him. Epstein's Resp. to RFAs #6.
10. Epstein owns and controls real estate property in foreign countries, including
the Caribbean. Epstein's Resp. to RFAs #7 and #8.
11. Epstein is currently moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of
the direct territorial reach of federal and Florida courts. Epstein's Resp. to RFA #21.
12. Epstein is transferring these assets with the intent to defeat any judgment
that might be entered against him in this and other similar cases. Epstein's Resp. to
RFA#22.

13. Epstein could currently post a $15 million bond to satisfy a judgment in this
case without financial or other difficulty. Epstein's Resp. to RFA #23.
14. Epstein has blocked all discovery, in this and other related cases, regarding

his assets. Affidavit of Paul Cassell at 7, 8.
ARGUMENT
I. EPSTEIN IS FRAUDULENTLY TRANSFERRING HIS ASSETS.
As noted in the material facts above, defendant Epstein is currently making
fraudulent transfers of his assets. In particular, he is currently moving significant
financial assets overseas, outside of the direct territorial reach of Federal and Florida
courts, and is doing so with the specific intent to defeat any judgment that might be
entered against him in this and other similar cases. Statement of Material Facts #11
and #12.
Because these material facts rest, in part, on Epstein's invocation of his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, it is pertinent to note that Jane Doe is
entitled to an adverse inference from his invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights when
asked whether he was fraudulently transferring his assets overseas. Jane Doe
propounded requests for admission to Epstein that asked specifically about on-going
fraudulent transfers of assets. In response, Epstein asserted his Fifth Amendment right
to refuse to answer incriminating questions. Of course, Epstein's "invocation of his Fifth
Amendment privilege, like the assertion of any privilege, stands in stark opposition to
the otherwise liberal discovery rules, and 'undermine[s] to some degree the trial
system's capacity to ascertain the truth."' United States ex rel. DRC, Inc. v. Custer
Battles, LLC, 415 F.Supp.2d 628, 632 (E.D. Va. 2006) (quoting Robert Heidt, The
8
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 9 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
Conjurer's Circle - The Fiffh Amendment Privilege in Civil Cases, 91 YALE L.J. 1062,
1082 (1982)). As a result, where a witness refuses to testify in a civil case on Fifth
Amendment grounds, the permissible inference is that the witness's testimony, had it
been given, "would not have been favorable to the claim." United States v. A Single
Family Residence, 803 F.2d 625, 629 n.4 (11th Cir. 1986). Of course, the Fifth
Amendment is not violated by such an inference. The concerns animating the Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination are not in play "[i]n a civil suit involving only
private parties" because "no party brings to the battle the awesome powers of the
government, and therefore to permit an adverse inference to be drawn from exercise of
the privilege does not implicate the policy considerations underlying the privilege."
Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S.308, 335 (1976).
An adverse inference is entirely justified in this case. Epstein has remained
silent when asked such straightforward requests for admissions:
• Since being incarcerated you have, directly or indirectly (through the
services or assistance of other persons), conveyed money or assets in an
attempt to insulate or protect your money or assets from being captured in
any civil lawsuits filed against you. RFA's #6.
• You are moving significant financial assets overseas, outside of the direct
territorial reach of the U.S. and Florida Courts. RFA's #21.
• You are making asset transfers with the intent to defeat any judgment that
might be entered against you in this or similar cases. RFA's #22.

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 10 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
The silence in the face of these questions speaks far louder than words. As Justice
Brandeis recognized long ago, "[s]ilence is often evidence of the most persuasive
character."' Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 319 (1976) (quoting U.S. ex rel.
Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149, 153-54 (1923)). This is plainly one of those
situations.
In a civil case, drawing an adverse inference is the proper action for a court to
take when a litigant blocks legitimate discovery through exercise of a Fifth Amendment
invocation. "[W]hile there is no doubt that a witness is entitled to assert the privilege in
a civil case, it is also clear that an adverse inference based on a refusal to answer in a
civil case is an appropriate remedy, as it provides some relief for the civil litigant whose
case is unfairly prejudiced by a witness' assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege
without placing the witness in the 'cruel trilemma' of choosing among incrimination,
perjury, or contempt." United States ex rel. DRC, Inc. v. Custer Battles, LLC, 415
F.Supp.2d 628, 633 (E.D. Va. 2006). The Eleventh Circuit has not hesitated to support
district courts that draw an adverse inference from silence. For example, in United
States v. Two Parcels of Real Property, 92 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir. 1996), the district
court drew an adverse inference when claimants to real property refused to answer
questions regarding the property. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed that decision,
explaining that "[t]his Court has held ... that the trier of fact may take an adverse
inference against parties to a civil action refusing to testify on Fifth Amendment
grounds. Id. at 1129 (citing United States v. A Single Family Residence, 803 F.2d 625,
629 n.4 (11th Cir. 1986)). Similarly, in Arango v. U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, 115 F.3d
922, 926 (11th Cir. 1997), the Eleventh Circuit explained that "the First Amendment
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 11 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
does not forbid adverse inferences against civil litigants ... who assert the privilege
against self-incrimination."
Here an adverse inference is entirely appropriate. In addition to Epstein's refusal
to answer questions, there are strong circumstantial reasons for believing he is hiding
his assets. As explained above, see Statement of Material Facts #1 through #3,
Epstein clearly has the means to hide his assets - he is a sophisticated financial
advisor. And given that the sexual abuse lawsuits brought against Epstein threaten him
with financial ruin - he has a clear motive for hiding his substantial assets. Finally,
Epstein is currently on work release, running his financial affairs from his office - giving
him the clear opportunity to make the necessary arrangements to move his assets to
overseas or other unreachable locations. Thus, there is a "perfect circumstantial
evidence case that [Epstein] ha[s] means, motive, and opportunity" to fraudulently
transfer assets. See United States v. Sparks, 265 F.3d 825, 830 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding
probable cause for an arrest based solely on a showing of means, motive, and
opportunity). The fact that this evidence is circumstantial rather than direct proof of the
transfers is irrelevant, because "'circumstantial evidence is not less probative than direct
evidence, and, in some cases is even more reliable."' United States v. Ranum, 96 F.3d
1020, 1026 (7th Cir. 1996) (quoting United States v. Hatchett, 31 F.3d 1411, 1421 (7th
Cir. 1994 )).
For all these reasons, the Court should conclude that Epstein is fraudulently
transferring assets.

CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
II. JANE DOE IS ENTITELD TO THE PROTECTIONS OF THE UNIFORM
FRAUDULENT TRANSFER ACT AS ADOPTED BY FLORIDA
In light of Epstein's fraudulent asset transfers, Jane Doe is entitled to pre
judgment remedies to protect her against Epstein's efforts to block her from satisfying
the judgment she is likely to ultimately obtain in this case. Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 64 guarantees Jane Doe during the course of this suit "all remedies providing
for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment
ultimately to be entered in the action" that are "available under the circumstances and in
the manner provided by the law of the state in which the court is held." The Rule goes
on to provide that "[t]he remedies thus available include arrest, attachment,
garnishment, replevin, sequestration, and other corresponding or equivalent remedies,
however designated and regardless of whether by state procedure the remedy is
ancillary to an action or must be obtained by an independent action." This "long-settled
federal law provid[es] that in all cases in federal court , ... state law is incorporated to
determine the availability of prejudgment remedies for the seizure of person or property
to secure satisfaction of the judgment ultimately entered." Rosen v. Cascade Intern.,
Inc., 21 F.3d 1520, 1531 (11th Cir. 1994). Accordingly, under this Rule, this Court looks
to Florida law to determine Jane Doe's rights to pre-judgment relief.
To prevent fraudulent transfers of assets before judgment, Florida has adopted
the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. Fla. Stat. Ann. § 726.101 et seq. Under the
Florida's Uniform Transfer Act (FUFTA), courts are broadly empowered to take action to
block certain "fraudulent transfers" of assets. Jane Doe is accordingly entitled to invoke
the remedies under this Act if Epstein is making "fraudulent transfers" of his assets.
12
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 13 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
The Act defines a "fraudulent" transfer of assets as one made "[w]ith actual intent
to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor." Fla. Stat. Ann. § 726.105(1 )(a).
The FUFTA also contains a "quite broad" definition of "transfer." Nationsbank, N.A. v.
Coastal Utilities, Inc., 814 So.2d 1227, 1230 (Fla. Ct. Apps. 2002). It extends to "every
mode, direct or indict, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or
parting with an asset or an interest in an asset, and includes payment of money,
release, lease, and creation of a lien or other encumbrance." Fla. Stat. Ann. §
726.102(12). This "broad definition includes 'every' mode of disposing of an asset and
does not limit the statute to direct transactions made by the debtor him/herself."
Nationsbank, N.A. v. Coastal Utilities, Inc., 814 So.2d 1230. As noted above, Epstein is
transferring his assets with the intent to defeat any judgment that might be entered
against him in this and other similar cases, see Statement of Material Facts #12, and
therefore is plainly covered by the Act.
The FUFTA extends is protections to "creditors" -- such as Jane Doe, who is a
"creditor" of Epstein's within the meaning of the Act. The FUFTA extends its protections
not merely to judgment creditors, but more widely to future creditors who have a "claim,"
including a "claim" that has not yet been reduced to judgment. See Fla. Stat. Ann. §
726.102(2) (defining a claim as a "right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured."); Fla. Stat. Ann. § (defining
creditor protected by the act as "a person who has a claim"). See generally Freeman v.
First Union Nat. Bank, 865 So.2d 1272, 1277 (Fla. 2004) (noting that the definition of
13
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 14 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
claim is "broadly constructed" under the FUFTA). This means that "as is universally
accepted, as well as settled in Florida, a 'claim' under the Act may be maintained even
though contingent and not yet reduced to judgment." Freeman, 865 at 1277 (internal
quotations omitted). In Florida, then, "'tort claimants are as fully protected against
fraudulent transfers as holders of absolute claims."' Id. at 1277 (quoting Money v.
Powell, 139 So.2d 702, 703 (Fla. Ct. Apps. 1962). Jane Doe is, of course, a tort
claimant against Epstein.
For all these reasons, Jane is entitled to the full protections of the Florida Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act.
Ill. UNDER THE UNIFORM FRAUDULENT TRANSFER ACT, JANE DOE IS
ENTITLED TO THE REMEDIES OF APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER
TO TAKE CHARGE OF EPSTEIN'S ASSETS, FILE AN ACCOUNTING
OF THOSE ASSETS WITH THE COURT, AND TO POST A $15
MILLION BOND
Under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, this Court is given broad powers to
prevent fraudulent transfers of assets. The remedies provided by the Act specifically
include:
1. An injunction against further disposition by the debtor ... of the asset
transferred .... ;
2. Appointment of a receiver to take charge of the asset transferred or of
other property of the transferee; or
3. Any other relief the circumstances may require. Fla. Stat. Ann. §
726.108(c).
14
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 15 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
Jane Doe seeks one of these specifically provided remedies - namely,
appointment of a receiver to take charge of Epstein's assets. Appointment of a receiver
will serve three important goals: first, if a receiver has control of Epstein's assets,
Epstein's ability to further transfer those assets will be blocked; second, the receiver can
provide an accounting of Epstein's assets, allowing Jane Doe (and the Court) to take
whatever other action may be appropriate; and, third, the receiver can post a bond of
$15 million with the Court so that Jane Doe will have funds to satisfy any judgment that
she might obtain.
The Court should appoint a receiver to account for Epstein's assets. The
appointment of a receiver is directly authorized by the FUFTA. Fla. Stat. Ann. §
726.108(c); see Freeman v. First Union Nat. Bank, 865 So.2d 1272, 1277 (Fla. 2004)
(noting that appointment of a receiver is remedy provided by the FUFTA). A receiver is
the only way to start to block further dissipation of assets - by, first, gaining control over
Epstein's assets and then, second, making an accounting of what assets of Epstein's
remain in this country or are otherwise subject to control by this Court. Given Epstein's
Fifth Amendment invocations and other obstructions regarding any discovery
concerning his assets, see Statement of Material Facts #14, it is currently impossible for
Jane Doe to protect her interests in blocking Epstein's fraudulent transfers. Indeed, one
of the other remedies specifically specified in the Act - "[a]n injunction against further
disposition by the debtor ... of the asset transferred" - is presumably unworkable given
that there is no way to know what assets Epstein possesses, much less where he is
transferring them to. Cf. Special Purpose Accounts Receivable Co-op Corp. v. Prime
One Capital Co., L.L.C., 2007 WL 4482611 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (Marra, J.) (refusing to
15
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 16 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
apply any heightened pleading requirements to UFTA claims "[g]iven this lack of access
to information on the part of a plaintiff in a fraudulent transfer case"). Jane Doe
therefore needs a receiver to account for Epstein's assets to the Court.
The receiver should make a report to the Court regarding Epstein's assets so
that Jane Doe can determine what additional further action is required. For example,
Jane Doe might need to take action to set aside various transfers. But even now, it is
clear that the receiver should take one additional step: Once a receiver is appointed
and accounts for Epstein's assets, the receiver should post a $15 million bond on behalf
of Epstein with the Clerk of the Court in order to satisfy any judgment that Jane Doe
might obtain in this case.
A $15 million bond is reasonable. First, given Epstein's tremendous net worth,
he can post a $15 million bond without any financial or other difficulty. See Statement
of Material Facts #13. Second, given the egregious acts of sexual abuse Epstein
committed against Jane Doe (who was a minor at the time) - and the punitive damages
claim present in this case -- $15 million is a reasonable bond amount given the nature of
the judgment that Jane Doe is likely to obtain at trial. Jane Doe seeks more than $50
,r
million damages. See First Amended Complaint, 1. Her complaint alleges that Jeffrey
Epstein had a sexual obsession for minor girls. Id. at ,r 10. To satisfy that obsession,
Epstein engaged in an elaborate scheme whereby his assistants recruited minor girls
for the purpose of engaging in prostitution. Id. at ,r 11. Her complaint explains that:
Beginning in approximately February 2003 and continuing until
approximately June 2005, the defendant coerced and enticed the
impressionable, vulnerable, and economically deprived then minor [Jane
16
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 17 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
Doe] in order to commit various acts of sexual misconduct against her.
These acts included, but were not limited to, fondling and inappropriate
and illegal sexual touching of the then minor [Jane Doe], sexual
misconduct and masturbation of Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, in the
presence of the then minor Plaintiff, and encouraging and coercing the
then minor Plaintiff to become involved in prostitution.
Id. at ,r 18. Jane Doe finally notes that in June 2009, Epstein entered pleas of "guilty" to
various Florida state crimes involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the
procurement of minors for the purposes of prostitution, for which Defendant Epstein was
sentenced to 18 months incarceration in Palm Beach County jail to be followed by 12
months community control (house arrest). Id. at ,r 22.
Jane Doe has propounded various discovery requests regarding these
allegations to Jeffrey Epstein. It is noteworthy that Epstein has asserted a Fifth
Amendment self-incrimination privilege to these requests, rather than provide answers.
For example, Jane Doe has asked Epstein to admit that he committed sexual assault
against Jane Doe when she was minor. Plaintiff's First Request for Admissions to
Defendant Epstein 11. In response, Epstein asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege not
to incriminate himself.
For all these reasons, directing the receiver to post a $15 million bond on behalf
of Epstein is reasonable under the circumstances.
The UFTA "also grants the court equity powers to remedy ... fraud." lnvo
Florida, Inc. v. Somerset Venturer, Inc., 751 So.2d 1263, 1267 (Fla. Ct. Apps. 2000).
The FUFTA's provisions are "supplement[ed]" by "the principles of law and equity." Fla.
Stat. Ann. § 726.111. It is well-settled that "[a]n equitable action requires equitable
relief." Prince v. Tyler, 890 So.2d 246, 251 (Fla. 2004), and "equity will do what ought to
17
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 18 of 41
CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
be done." Sterling v. Brevard County, 776 So.2d 281, 284 (Fla. Ct. Apps. 2000). The
Court should therefore also exercise its equitable powers to impose the same remedies
that Jane Doe requests.
Of course, in equity, the Court considers the relative positions of the two
claimants. Here, Jane Doe has presented substantial claims of sexual abuse against
her while a minor, while Epstein (who pied guilty to felony charges involving such
conduct) has taken the Fifth Amendment rather than answer questions about his sexual
abuse of Jane Doe. If Jane Doe does not obtain the remedy that she is requesting,
then Epstein may well be able to move all of his assets to unreachable locations,
leaving her with a substantial tort claim and no possible way to satisfy it. On the other
hand, appointing a receiver will not interfere with any legitimate interest of Epstein,
particularly given his phenomenal wealth.
When this Court proceeds in equity, it "will not suffer a wrong to be without a
remedy." Connell v. Mittendorf, 147 So.2d 169, 172 (Fla. Ct. Apps. 1962). This case
cries out for the Court to intercede and take action to avoid allowing a confessed and
wealthy sex offender from concealing his assets and depriving his victims - including
Jane Doe - from satisfying any judgment that they may well obtain against him. A
receiver with control over Epstein's assets is a modest and entirely appropriate step to
take given Epstein's actions.
For the consideration of the Court, a proposed order adopting these remedies is
attached to this pleading.

CASE NO: 08-CV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, in view of the fraudulent transfers being made by Jeffrey Epstein
to prevent Jane Doe from satisfying any judgment she might obtain in this case, the
Court should appoint a receiver to take charge of Epstein's property and direct the
receiver to provide the Court with an accounting of Epstein's assets and post a $15
million bond to secure any potential judgment that Jane Doe might obtain in this case.

AFFIDAVIT OF PAUL G. CASSELL, ESQUIRE
1. I, Paul Cassell, have person lmowledge of the matters set forth herein. I
am an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Utah since 1992. My office is
located at the University of Utah College of Law, where I am a law professor.
Along with other attorneys, I represent plaintiff Jane Doe in this matter.
2. It appears that defendant Jeffrey Epstein is an extremely wealthy
individual. According to reputable press reports, his net worth is in the hundreds
of millions of dollars - if not, indeed, a billion dollars. See, e.g., New York Time,
July 1, 2008, at A2 ("Over the weekend Jeffrey E. Epstein, who after years of
advising billionaires became a billionaire himself, left his estate on Little St. James
Island, with its staff of 70 and its flamingo-stocked lagoon, boarded a private
helicopter and flew to Florida. There, he turned himself in at the Palm Beach
County jail and began serving 18 months for soliciting prostitution."). According
to the Wikipedia entry about Jeffrey Epstein, he is a billionaire and owner of a
private island in the Virgin Island (Little St. James Island), and was a financial
trader at Bear Steams. He then founded his own financial management firm, J.
..-- EXHIB\1
~
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 23 of 41
Epstein and Col, later called Financial Trust Co., located on his private island in
the U.S. Virgin Island. He reportedly only took billionaire clients. -
3. Other attorneys and I have made repeated efforts to find published
information about defendant Jeffrey Epstein in general and his financial dealings in
particular. The most detailed published source of information about defendant
Jeffrey Epstein that I have been able to locate is an article that was published in
Vanity Fair by Vicky Ward. Vicky Ward is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, a
contributor to CNBC, and a weekly columnist for the London Evening Standard.
The article can be found in the internet at
http://vickyward.com/wordpress/archives/30.\
4. According to the Vanity Fair article, defendant Jeffrey Epstein became
wealthy by managing the financial assets of other billionaires. He reportedly
limited his clients to those whose net worth was more than $1 billion. Unlike other
fund managers, however, Epstein kept all his deals and clients secret (with one
exception-billionaire Leslie Wexner-who Epstein claims was his mentor). He
has great skills in trading in international currency markets, which helped him
make money for himself and his clients. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that he
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 24 of 41
has significant financial sophistication, including sophistication about the
international transfer of financial instruments and other assets.
5. According to the Vanity Fair article, defendant Jeffrey Epstein's real
mentor was not Leslie Wexner, but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who was sent to
federal prison for twenty years for bilking investors out of more than $450 million
in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history. Epstein assisted
Hoffenberg with (failed) takeover bids of Pan American World Airways and
Emery Air Freight.
6. According to the Vanity Fair article, before working with Wexner and
Hoffenberg, defendant Jeffrey Epstein worked with Beam Stearns. He left the firm
very suddenly in 1981 after being questioned by S.E.C. investigators in an insider
trading scandal involving several Italian and Swiss investors.
7. According to the Vanity Fair article, Epstein recently owned (and thus
may still own) a Boeing 727 with a trading room.
8. Vicky Ward published a follow-up note to her earlier article in May
2008. It can be found at http:// www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/05/vicky-
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 25 of 41
ward-you.html. According to this note, rumors were circulating (to celebrities
such as Dustin Hoffman, Alec Baldwin, and filmmaker Michael Mailer) that
Epstein was moving all of his considerable assets to Israel. The note also indicated
that, having written the earlier detailed article about Epstein, Ward was now
:frequently viewed as an "expert" on Epstein.
9. According to reputable press reports, Jeffrey Epstein has travelled
internationally with Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, and Prince
Andrew. See, e.g., The Daily Mail, Prince Andrew's Billionaire Friend is Accused
ofP reying on Girl of 14, Apr. 29, 2007, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-
4513 72/Prince-Andrews-billionaire-friend-accused-preying-girl-14.html ("One of
Prince Andrew's closest friends [Jeffrey Epstein] is being investigated by the FBI
for allegedly paying under-age girls for tawdry sexual encounters."). It is therefore
reasonable to infer that he has international contacts, including international
financial contacts.
10. Approximately 25 civil suits have been filed in Florida state courts and
Florida federal courts raising similar allegations against J ef:frey Epstein. These
complaints seek damages comparable to those sought by Jane Doe in this case.
Accordingly, Epstein has currently pending against him lawsuits seeking more than
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 26 of 41
$1 billion in damages. Even given his great wealth, it appears that the lawsuits
against him could well lead to his financial ruin, unless he is able to conceal his
assets so that the plaintiffs in these cases are unable to reach them.
11. Since his guilty plea in state court, he has been incarcerated in the Palm
Beach County Detention facility. I have been advised, however, that he has
currently been allowed out on a "work release" program, where he works at
managing his financial interests.
12. Because of his overseas contacts, other plaintiff attorneys and I have
been greatly concerned that Epstein might attempt to transfer many of his assets
overseas with the intent to defeat any judgment that might be entered against him.
I have also received reports, that I am attempting to substantiate, that Epstein is
transferring his assets out of the country at this time with the intent to make it
impossible for Jane Doe and other plaintiffs to satisfy any significant judgment that
they might obtain against him. In light of these reports, other attorneys and I have
propounded the requests for admission regarding fraudulent asset transfers
discussed in the pending motion.
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document 165 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/19/2009 Page 27 of 41
13. In this case, Epstein has blocked all discovery regarding the current
location of his assets and recent fraudulent transfers of his assets, by asserting a
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. With other attorneys
working on this case ( and related cases), I have wanted to obtain direct, first hand
information regarding Epstein's financial dealings, but have been blocked for
doing so by Epstein. Therefore, I have been forced to rely on reputable press
reports for information about these dealings.
14. In the similar sexual abuse lawsuits filed against Epstein, other plaintiffs
attorneys have advised that Epstein has likewise blocked all discovery regarding
his finances with Fifth Amendment invocations or other interposed obstructions.

I swear the foregoing to be truthful under the penalty of p~rjury.
