ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN,

12 Plaintiff Jane Doe ("Doe" or "Plaintiff') alleges as follows:
13 INTRODUCTION
14 1. This case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation of a young girl by
15 notorious pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). It all started in 1994
16 when 13-year-old Jane Doe met Epstein and Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell ("Maxwell") at a
17 summer camp in Michigan. Jane Doe was their first known victim and was subsequently abused
18 by Epstein and Maxwell for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and
19 psychological trauma and distress. Despite that, Jane Doe has persevered and survived to tell her
20 story, to hold her perpetrators accountable and to seek justice for the atrocities committed against
21 her.
22 2. Throughout his life, Epstein systematically perpetrated acts of molestation,
23 exploitation, assault and rape on hundreds of young girls. Epstein's system of abuse was
24 facilitated in large part by his co-conspirator and accomplice, Maxwell, who helped supply him
25 with a steady stream of young and vulnerable girls-many of whom were fatherless, like Jane
26 Doe, and came from struggling families.

1 3. This system, which took years to develop, all started with them exploiting and
2 abusing Jane Doe who they used as a guinea pig to refine their criminal enterprise and widen their
3 network of additional sexual abuse victims.
4 THE PARTIES
5 4. Plaintiff Jane Doe is a citizen of the State of California. At all times relevant to this
6 suit, Doe was a minor child living in Florida and New York and who was sexually abused while
7 she was a minor by Defendants in New York.
8 5. Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in the State of New York.
9 6. Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the
10 Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein.
11 7. Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the
12 Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein.
13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14 8. Plaintiff is domiciled in California.
15 9. Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin
16 Islands at the time of his death. As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein,
17 Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The matter
18 in controversy exceeds the sum of$75,000, and therefore jurisdiction in this Court is proper. 28
19 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(2).
20 10. Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in New York.
21 11. A substantial part of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the
22 Southern District of New York, thus venue in this district is proper. 28 U.S.C. § 139l(b)(2).
23 JURY DEMAND
24 12. Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all of her claims in this action.
25 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
26 Epstein and Maxwell's Abuse of Doe
27 13. In the summer of 1994, Jane Doe met Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at
28 Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan when she was only 13-years-old. Doe was there as a student

1 in the voice program. Doe was sitting alone on a bench between classes when Epstein and
2 Maxwell approached her. Epstein bragged to her about being a patron of the arts and giving
3 scholarships to talented young artists like Doe. Epstein and Maxwell probed her at length about
4 her background, family situation and where she lived. As Doe got up to leave, Epstein requested
5 her mother's phone number back in Florida. She was alarmed by his request, but also feared that
6 she could not refuse the older man's request so she complied and provided him with the phone
7 number.
8 14. Several weeks later, once Doe had returned from Michigan to Florida, Epstein
9 called Doe's home. Epstein first spoke with Doe's mother about how he mentors young kids and
10 provides scholarships for the arts. He requested to speak to Doe and invited her and her mother to
p.. 11 his mansion in Palm Beach. He sent a driver across town to pick them up.

19 pedophilic ways when shopping with Doe and Maxwell. Instead of Doe picking out clothes she
20 wanted to wear, Epstein insisted that she pick out and wear little children's cotton underwear.
21 Also, after nearly every visit with Epstein and Maxwell, Epstein sent Doe home with two or three
22 one-hundred-dollar bills to give her mother since "she 's having a hard time and struggling as a
23 widow."
24 16. While these visits made Doe extremely uncomfortable, Epstein and Maxwell made
25 her feel she could not refuse them. During this time, Epstein started to pay for voice lessons for
26 Doe and insisted that Doe could not advance her career in any way without him. When Doe
27 expressed hesitation about spending time with Epstein and Maxwell or acquiescing to their
28 desires, Epstein and Maxwell would threaten Doe, and scold her for being "ungrateful".

17. During one of Doe's encounters with Epstein, he took her to Mar-a-Lago where he
2 introduced her to its owner, Donald J. Trump. Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J. Trump,
3 Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, "This is a good one, right?"
4 Trump smiled and nodded in agreement. They both chuckled and Doe felt uncomfortable, but, at
5 the time, was too young to understand why.
6 18. Towards the end of 1994, Epstein invited Doe into his pool house, where he
7 grabbed her, put her on his lap and started masturbating. Epstein told her that was what to expect
8 from photographers who were soon going to be take modeling pictures of her. However, when
9 Doe was ultimately photographed by these professional photographers, they did no such thing.
10 19. Over the next few years, the sexual abuse escalated. On a regular basis, Epstein
i::i.. 11 would digitally penetrate Doe, force Doe to perform sexual acts on him and apply vibrators on

20 completely dependent on him financially (including, for the roof over their heads), Epstein's abuse
21 of Doe continued to escalate.
22 22. In 1997, while at Epstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in the City ofNew
23 York, Epstein asked 17-year-old Doe if she had a boyfriend. Doe replied that she did not. Epstein
24 responded that when she did have a boyfriend she would want the sex to be "good' and that she
25 should "get it over with already," meaning lose her virginity. Despite Doe's resistance, Epstein
26 then pushed Doe down onto her stomach and raped her. From that point forward for several years
27 in New York, Epstein raped Doe on multiple occasions.

1 23. During Doe's time in New York, Maxwell also regularly facilitated Epstein's abuse
2 of Doe and was frequently present when it occurred.
3 24. In 1999, Doe moved to Los Angeles to start a career. Upon moving to Los Angeles
4 and being physically away from Epstein and Maxwell, Doe finally felt like she could escape
5 Epstein's abuse and stopped returning his frequent calls where he would threaten and berate her for
6 not appreciating him.
7 25. Despite Doe's physical escape from Epstein and Maxwell, the years of abuse and
8 exploitation perpetrated against her by them cause her immeasurable pain and suffering every day.
9 Epstein's Death and Will
10 26. In July 2019, Epstein was indicted by the Unites States Attorney's Office for the
11 Southern District of New York.
12 27. On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan
13 Correctional Center, where he was being held pending trial. Upon information and belief, New
14 York City's medical examiner concluded Epstein died by suicide.
15 28. On August 15, 2019, Epstein's last will and testament (the "Will") was filed in the
16 Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands.
17 29. The Will indicated that it was executed by Epstein on August 8, 2019 at the
18 Metropolitan Correctional Center. The Will was accompanied by affidavits from Darren K.
19 Indyke and Richard D. Kahn attesting to their "Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and
20 Appointment of Local Counsel." Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn also filed a Petition for Probate and for
21 Letters Testamentary in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands.
22 30. The Will's first article directs Epstein's executors "to pay from my estate all
23 expenses of my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my
24 estate and all of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate." The Will further directs
25 that "after the payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST," Epstein "give[s] all ofmy
26 property, real and personal, wherever situated ... to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust."
