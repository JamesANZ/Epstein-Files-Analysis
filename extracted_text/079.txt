Re: Reply in Support of Letter Motion to Stay Proceedings
20-cv-484 (JGK-DCF), Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke, et al.
Dear Judge Freeman:
On behalf of defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, I write in further support of a
Motion to Stay Proceedings in this matter until the conclusion of the criminal trial in
United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (“Criminal Case”).
Plaintiff apparently concedes, by failing to respond, that (a) she is one of the
three accusers mentioned in the Indictment in the Criminal Case, (b) substantial
overlap, if not complete identity, therefore exists between the issues, witnesses and
facts in the Criminal Case and her request for tens of millions of dollars from Ms.
Maxwell in this case, (c) an indictment is legally “the most important factor” in a
motion to stay parallel civil proceedings, (d) judicial economy will best be served by
allowing the Criminal Case to proceed first, and (e) absent a stay, Ms. Maxwell will
be forced to choose between her constitutional right to remain silent and her active
and vigorous participation in defending against and refuting plaintiff’s false claims in
this case.
Instead, Plaintiff argues that a stay would harm her (unspecified) interests and
that litigating from inside the MDC under COVID-lockdown is “not [a] great”
burden. Both arguments are borderline frivolous.
No articulated harm to Plaintiff’s interests: Despite proclaiming a stay will
“harm plaintiff’s interests,” she fails to explain why. Ipse dixit aside, Plaintiff
correctly explains that she can participate in the Epstein claims program while
simultaneously pursuing this civil action and (apparently) advancing her interests
through the Criminal Case. But she does not explain why the parties should be forced

to expend Estate and Ms. Maxwell’s resources litigating this civil case during the
pendency of both the Epstein Claims Program and the criminal trial. If it is money
she seeks, she can pursue it in the Claims Program during the stay or, barring
successful participation, in a civil case to resume in August 2021, after Ms. Maxwell
is at liberty to refute Plaintiff’s claims. If it is “justice” she seeks, the Criminal Case
will resolve those issues one way or the other. Plaintiff does not articulate a basis for
her desire to pursue all three avenues simultaneously nor why such multiple paths are
necessary to achieve her “interests.” Perhaps not surprisingly, she also cites no legal
authority to bolster her argument that she be permitted to do so.
Burden of Covid-lockdown in-custody litigation substantial: Plaintiff also
contends that Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concerns regarding the burden of litigating
from detention in the MDC under Covid-restrictions are somehow overblown. As
support, Plaintiff points out that that counsel on behalf of Ms. Maxwell filed an
answer denying all of Plaintiff’s allegations and served discovery requests on
Plaintiff. Respectfully, it appears Plaintiff’s counsel has not thought through, or is
ignorant of, the current situation in detention in New York and the demands on a
party in a civil litigation:
First, Ms. Maxwell cannot be deposed based on the current limitations put in
place in the MDC by the Bureau of Prisons.
Second, Ms. Maxwell cannot participate in any other party or witness
deposition.
Third, Ms. Maxwell cannot receive, review, edit or comment on pleadings,
except via U.S. Mail in both directions. All such mail is taking over a week to get to
her in one direction.
Fourth, Ms. Maxwell cannot go through her records, her computers, her
photos, her documents, or any other file from the time period 1994-1999 to prepare
her defense to Plaintiff’s claims.
Fifth, even phone contact with Ms. Maxwell is limited, difficult and
unpredictable. Legal calls are not always granted; many have been denied even as
deadlines in the civil and criminal case are looming. On the best of days, these
discretionary phone conferences must be scheduled at least three days in advance and
are limited in duration, many times to 15 minutes.
Undersigned counsel has represented incarcerated individuals in other civil
and criminal litigation. While it is possible to do so under normal conditions, the
COVID ban on in-person visits, inability to bring documents into and out of the
facility, and the age of the claims in this case renders the burden far more than
Plaintiff apparently appreciates. That counsel for Ms. Maxwell was able to orally
