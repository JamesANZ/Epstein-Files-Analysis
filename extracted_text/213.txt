ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
OF THE TRIAL CROURT’S FEBRUARY 29, 2024 ORDER
AND CANCELING JULY 8, 2024 HEARING
E
C
THIS CAUSE, having come before the Court on The Palm Beach Post’s Motion for
Reconsideration of ThAe Trial Court’s February 29, 2024 Order, filed on June 12, 2024, and the
Court, having considered the Motion, being advised of the arguments of the parties, and being
T
otherwise aOdvised of the premises, the Court Grants the Motion for Reconsideration and adjudicates
N
the following:
Procedural History
In 2019, The Palm Beach Post commenced this action seeking a declaration authorizing
the release of testimony and related evidence presented to the Palm Beach County grand jury in
2006 during the first Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”) sex abuse investigation.
FILED: PALM BEACH COUNTY, FL, JOSEPH ABRUZZO, CLERK, 07/01/2024 01:52:43 PM
On December 21, 2021, the trial court entered a Final Judgment dismissing The Palm
Beach Post’s First Amended Complaint on the grounds that the Court lacked the statutory
authority, under Florida Statute 905.27, to order the release of the Epstein grand jury materials.
On May 10, 2023, the Fourth District Court of Appeal remanded the case to the Circuit
Y
Court to conduct an in camera inspection of the Epstein grand jury materials to determine whether
P
public disclosure would be “furthering justice” as defined by Florida Statute 905.27.
O
The Court ultimately determined the request did not furthCer justice under the law as it
existed at the time. The Court stated that it must follow the law and cannot create new law. Law
D
making is a process that belongs exclusively to the peEople of Florida when they speak through
I
their legislature and the executive branches. This concept is rudimentary and basic civics. The
F
Courts interpret law - THE COURTS DO NOTI MAKE LAW.
T
R
It is also important to note, that without an amendment to the statute, Grand Jury
E
proceedings are generally always kept secret and are closed to the public. This is generally to
C
protect jurors, witnesses, those accused, and the integrity of the case. Secrecy allows people to
A
serve as jurors and witnesses to testify without fear of outside influence or retaliation. In some
T
cases, it also ensures the protection of an innocent suspect’s reputation. Secrecy also makes it less
O
likely that a defendant will abscond after learning they are being investigated. While those do not
N
apply to Epstein, the law at the time did not carve out an exception.
During this time, among others, the Clerk of Court, Mr. Joseph Abruzzo, a former state
legislator with vast experience in the legislative process, advocated to state legislators to amend
the law. Their efforts were successful. Florida’s Legislature unanimously passed Bill HB 117.
Once the bill passed both of the legislative houses, the Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis
very quickly signed CS/HB117 amending Florida Statute 905.27 effective July 1, 2024. This
amendment significantly modified the definition of “furthering justice” to expressly include
furthering a public interest when the disclosure is requested pursuant to paragraph 905.27(2)(c).
It cannot be understated that the amendment to the law very clearly allows what previously was
Y
not legally permissible. P
O
The Court’s Order denying the release of the records also gave leave of Court for The Palm
C
Beach Post to file a motion for reconsideration after July 1, 2024 - under the new statute.
D
On June 12, 2024, The Palm Beach Post movedE for reconsideration of the Trial Court’s
I
order based on the Florida Statute 905.27, as amended on July 1, 2024.
F
I
It cannot be disputed that the 2024 aTmendments to Florida Statute 905.27 were intended to
R
remove the prior statutory hurdles to disclosure of the Epstein grand jury materials. In fact, the
E
Court notes the bill was often called the “Epstein Grand Jury Bill” recognizing the prior statutory
C
construction did not allow release of these records.
A
In the official press release, Gov. DeSantis explained his reasons for signing of CS/HB 117
T
into law. Gov. DeSantis stated, “The public deserves to know who participated in the Jeffery
O
EpsteiNn sex trafficking. Nobody should be protected from facing justice due to their wealth, or
status, and those who harm children should be exposed and punished to the fullest extent of the
law.”
Conclusions of Fact and Law
Florida Statute 905.27(2)(c) now reads as follows:
When a court orders the disclosure of such testimony pursuant to subsection (1) in
response to a request by the media or an interested person, regardless of whether
that purpose is for use in a criminal or civil case, it may be disclosed so long as the
subject of the grand jury inquiry is deceased, the grand jury inquiry related to
criminal or sexual activity between the subject of the grand jury investigation and
Y
a person who was a minor at the time of the alleged criminal or sexual activity, the
testimony was previously disclosed by a court order, and the state attorney is
P
provided notice of the request. This paragraph does not limit the court's ability to
O
limit the disclosure of testimony, including, but not limited to, redaction.
C
With that new legal mechanism in place, the Court makes the Following Findings.
D
The Court finds that the request involves a matter of public interest. The criminal
E
prosecutions of the most infamous pedophile in American history began in Palm Beach County –
I
F
with much controversy. For almost 20 years, the story of how Jeffrey Epstein victimized some of
I
T
Palm Beach County’s most vulnerable has been the subject of much anger and has at times
R
diminished the public’s perception of the criminal justice system.
E
C
Adding to the public interest, Epstein is indeed notorious and infamous and is widely
reported to have flauntAed his wealth while cavorting with politicians, billionaires, and even British
Royalty. It is understandable that given those reports the public has a great curiosity about what
T
was widelyO reported by news agency as “special treatment” regarding his prosecution. This matter
N
is clearly the subject of public interest.
The Court finds that this request is made by the news media, specifically The Palm Beach
Post. The Palm Beach Post is a daily newspaper that was founded in 1916 as a local publication
in West Palm Beach. For decades, the Palm Beach Post was printed and published daily in Palm
Beach County. The Court finds that despite its many changes, The Palm Beach Post has a long and
rich history documenting our local community. Many local residents still rely on The Palm Beach
Post to obtain information on national, state, and local events. The Palm Beach Post remains a
newspaper of record in our county.
The Court finds Epstein is also widely reported to have been deceased since August 10,
2019, under controversial and “newsworthy” circumstances, while under “supervision” at
Y
Metropolitan Correctional Center in the state of New York. This adds to the public interest.
P
Having reviewed the testimony, the Court also finds the testimony relates to sexual activity
O
between Epstein and child victims of sex trafficking. Again, it is wCidely accepted that Epstein is
a notorious and serial pedophile. The testimony taken by the Grand Jury concerns activity ranging
D
from grossly unacceptable to rape – all of the conduct atE issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and
I
criminal.
F
I
The details in the record will be ouTtrageous to decent people. It is also important to note
R
that some of the testimony in the records of Epstein’s pedophilia involved other people, but there
E
is nothing in this record that was outside the knowledge of law enforcement or Prosecutors
C
– there is no new information.
A
Tragically, th e record reveals that Epstein used children to find more victims. The record
T
also shows that some of the children knew the type of people they could be exposed to and the
O
infamNous nature of such “notable” people.
The Court also notes the testimony was previously disclosed to law enforcement agencies.
Furthermore, the State Attorney was properly noticed and long ago withdrew any objections to
release the records and early on even did his best to disclose the information in his office’s
possession without delay via an internet portal. As a result, he was eventually dropped as a named
party in this action after much inconvenience and expense.
IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED,
The Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDED,
Y
P
The hearing scheduled for July 8, 2024 is moot and is canceled.
O
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDED,
C
The Palm Beach Post’s petition to release the GranDd Jury proceedings regarding Jeffery
E
Epstein under Florida Statute 905.27 as amended July 1, 2024 is also GRANTED.
I
F
With only a few redactions made by the Court to protect the identity of the minors,
I
T
The Court hereby authorizes the Clerk of Court to release the redacted Clerks Notes and transcripts
R
of the testimony in their entirety (attached as Exhibit “A”). The Court is not aware of anything
E
more to review and disclose.
C
DONE and ORADERED at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida.

20 And one important thing is, you're

O
8 Like, I don't know. I was kind of
C

23 give him a massage. And then he's making
24 conversation, asking me exactly what was
25 going to tell me to do. Like, if -- what high

D
10 And then he's like, oh, well, you don't
E
11 have to stand up, you can sit on the table.
I
12 And so I sat Fon the table and I was giving
I
13 him a massage. TAnd I think the massage -- it was
14 a couple min R utes, like 15 or 20 minutes. And this
E
15 whole time we were just conversating about
C
16 anything.
A
17 And he was telling me how he had another
18 T house in New York, and just a whole bunch of stuff
O
19 that I was, like, amused by. And then after like
N
20 20 minutes of giving him a massage, or 30 minutes
21 or something -- it was around that time, he asked
22 me if I wanted to make an extra hundred dollars.
23 And all -- that he'd have to use --

21 your bare buttocks to his bare buttocks?
22 A. Yeah. Well, kind of. There was towel
23 that -- like, it was kind of covering his butt but

26
1 But I was laying, like, on his lower back
2 near his butt. But, like, I wasn't on his butt.

16 And then I said, sure.
A
17 And then he's like, but I, um, have to --
18 T like, you're not going to be giving the massage
O
19 anymore, it's going to be something different.
N
20 And I was like, well, what is it?
21 And then he's like, um, can I use a
22 vibrator on you?
23 And I said, um, okay.
24 And then -- so then he got up and he went
25 into the -- his, like, other room for a couple
27
1 seconds; like literally a couple seconds; and then
2 came back in the room.
3 And next to the little vanity, big mirror,
4 and all this big table there was, like, on the
5 floor, there was just like the vibrator. Or
6 what -- it looked like a vibrator to m Y e.
7 Q. What did it look like? P
O
8 A. It was, like, purple. And it was like --
C
9 it was kind of like a massager but not really.
D

E
11 really a massager. And --
I
12 Q. What was it sFhaped like.
I
13 A. Um, like Tcircular in the top, and then it
R
14 was like a handle on the bottom.
E
15 Q. Okay. All right.
C
16 A. And then, um, after he grabbed that he laid
A
17 back on the table, and -- except this time he was
18 T on his back. And I was partially on the table,
O
19 like, half of my butt cheek and my leg was on the
N
20 table, and the one leg was on the floor. And,
21 like, sometimes I'd put it on the couch. Like,
22 cause the couch was right here and the table was
23 right there, so it was kind of close.
24 And I he told me to keep giving him a
25 massage, but to give a massage on his chest.
28
1 Q. So you're sitting on the table now and he's
2 standing up?
3 A. No, no, no. He was laying back on the
4 table, but like I was kind of on the table. Like,
5 half my butt and my leg was on the table, and the
6 other half was, like, par -- like, on Y the couch.
7 Like, I was holding -- P
O
8 Q. Okay. But he's laying down?
C
9 A. Uh-huh.
D
10 Q. Okay.
E
11 A. And, um, then I was giving a massage on his
I
12 chest and he was stFill talking for a couple
I
13 minutes. And thTen he used the vibrator. And,
14 like, that wa R s for like 10 minutes maybe or so, I
E
15 think. And then --
C
16 Q. Now, he -- I have to be detailed here.
A
17 Where was he using the vibrator?
18 T A. Can I say -- along my vagina.
O
19 Q. Okay.
N
20 A. I don't know what else to say.
21 Q. All right. Go ahead.
22 A. Okay. And then -- and then after -- for a
23 couple minutes that's what he was doing. And then
24 he jerked off for like a couple minutes.
25 Like, I was still on the table. And
29
1 told me that if -- if you -- like, if he does
2 that, then you have to get more money, because
3 that's like -- he gives you extra money if he
4 jerks off anyways. Cause I guess it's some --
5 like his (indiscernible) or whatever. And
6 Q. And had told you that bef Y ore?
7 A. Mm-hmm. She -- I -- she toldP me that,
O
8 like, the night that I, like, had this whole
C
9 conversation with her, and she told me about it.
10 Q. Okay. So she just D didn't tell you you were
E
11 going for a massage, she told you that there
I
12 you might have to taFke your clothes off?
I
13 A. No. She Tdidn't tell me that I would had to
14 take my cloth R es off, but she said that if he jerks
E
15 off in front of you, then you can get more money.
C
16 Q. Okay. So when he offered you the extra
A
17 hundred dollars, you had a pretty good idea what
18 T was coming next?
O
19 A. Yeah .
N
20 Q. Okay.
21 A. And, um
22 Q. And when you say "jerked off" what do you
23 mean?
24 A. He put his hand on his penis, and started
25 going up and down kind of fast.
30
1 Q. Okay. Could you see his penis at that
2 point?
3 A. Uh-huh.
4 Q. Is that a yes?
5 A. Yes .
6 Q. All right. Go ahead. Y

O
8 A. A couple seconds maybe. Like yeah,
C
9 like, 40 seconds. And then and then after
10 that, like, the massage wa D s over.
E
11 And he went into the -- out of the door
I
12 back to wherever he Fgoes. I couldn't see where he
I
13 was going cause Tthe door was this way and he
14 walked out. RAnd I guess he had like a -- his
E
15 money behind the door, cause it only took a couple
C
16 of seconds for him to come back in the room.
A
17 And then he opened his money, like, his
18 T wad, and gave me three hundred dollar bills. And
O
19 told me, thank you. And I --
N
20 And then he's like -- there was a note pad
21 there next to the couch -- and told me to write my
22 name and my number; cause I had a cell phone at
23 the time. And he told me to write my cell phone
24 number down, and how he could get hold of me and
25 all this stuff.
31
1 So I wrote my number down, and wrote my
2 name. And then after that he just left the room
3 and told me I could get dressed again and that it
4 was done. I was over.
5 Q. Did you actually see him ejaculate?

14 RA JUROR: Oh that's -- okay.
E
15 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Did Jeffrey Epstein

A
17 through Sarah Kellen?
18 T THE WITNESS: Through Sarah Kellen,
O

N
20 MS. BELOHLAVEK: So we don't have any
21 of the girls actually making an appointment

24 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Were you able to
25 talk with Sarah Kellen?

Y
7 THE WITNESS: He knew t P hat based on

10 MS. BELOHLAVEDK: Anyone else?
11 A JUROR: E What -- what year, when she
I
12 received the Fflowers, what class was she
I
13 in? Was it a Senior? A Junior?
T
14 RTHE WITNESS: I want to say Senior,
E
15 but I'm not a hundred percent positive on
C
16 that.
A
17 A JUROR: Why I ask that is that, you
18 T know, usually a Senior can be 18 years old,
O
19 whereas a Junior is, you know, that was --
N
20 THE WITNESS: Right.
21 A JUROR: That would give him some
22 knowledge of knowing how old she was.

24 A JUROR: The two girls that received
25 rental cars, their parents never asked them
97

C
9 the car is a friend's car or is borrowed .
10 MS. BELOHLAVEDK: Yes, sir?
11 A JUROR: E (Indiscernible) confirm, I
I
12 believe it wFas had indicated that the
I
13 conversation with Jeffrey Epstein was

14 that -R- to make sure that the girls were
E
15 young.
C
16 THE WITNESS: The younger the better.
A

O
19 THE WITNESS: Younger the better was
N
20 the quote.
21 A JUROR: And in that conversation,
22 was that in reference to specifically your
23 friends from your school or --

25 Because she brought a 23-year old to
98
1 provide a massage, and he told her she was
2 too old.

24 made him 52, 53 years of age.

1 during the times of these events?
2 THE WITNESS: Correct.
3 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Okay. All right.
4 Thank you very much.
5 A JUROR: One more.
6 THE WITNESS: I think there's another
Y
7 question. P
O
8 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Oops. Sorry.
C
9 A JUROR: Is there any other evidence
10 that the girls wereD in his house besides
E
11 the one tape, besides what they're saying?
I
12 THE WIFTNESS: He did have two
I
13 cameras, two covert hidden cameras inside
T
14 his hoRuse for security purposes. We did
E
15 locate that computer.
C
16 I reviewed the images in the
A
17 computer, and within that computer there
18 T are photographs of girls that I had
O
19 previous interviewed that appears to be
N
20 them.
21 However, because it's so grainy, so
22 snowy, a positive rec -- a positive
23 identification is -- you know, it's hard
24 to -- unless you show it to the girl, is
25 this you?
100
1 Which I haven't done, because I
2 too much information was being leaked back
3 to him. So that's why I pretty much
4 stopped giving them information as far as
5 this investigation.
6 MS. BELOHLAVEK: So you can't say
Y
7 specifically then the picture P s are of the
O
8 girls involved?
C
9 THE WITNESS: I cannot say
10 positively. I can Dsay that this girl
E
11 appeared to be like -- just like
I
12 Same hairstyFle, same mannerisms of walking,
I
13 same clothes that -- typical that I've seen
T
14 her wRear; but I can't say for a hundred
E
15 percent that this is her.
C
16 This appears to be her. The same
A
17 body style, face, that type of
18 T MS. BELOHLAVEK: And the girls are
O
19 still in touch with him, telling him about
N
20 your investigation.
21 THE WITNESS: I know for a fact that
22
23 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Or telling Sarah or
24 Nada.
25 THE WITNESS: Right. I know that
101
1 has called. And other girls that
2 I've interviewed or approached to be
3 interviewed have called him. And
4 MS. BELOHLAVEK: And there are other
5 girls that refuse to talk to you?
6 THE WITNESS: Right. Y
7 MS. BELOHLAVEK: I loveP Jeffrey, I'm
O
8 not testifying against him.
C
9 THE WITNESS: Right.
D
10 A JUROR: One question. Didn't you
E
11 say that the place in Palm Beach has the
I
12 residence unFder surveillance?
I
13 THTE WITNESS: When the when I took
R
14 over the investigation I had our TAC team
E
15 conduct physical surveillance. And they
C
16 observed these girls coming to the
A
17 residence in their vehicles, in their dad's
T
18 car, in their mom's cars, coming to the
O
19 house seeing Epstein. The --
N
20 A JUROR: So you do have witnesses
21 that can put these girls in -
22 THE WITNESS: Absolutely.
23 A JUROR: that particular
24 THE WITNESS: Absolutely.
25 A JUROR: There's one other thing. I
102
1 forgot.
2 MS. BELOHLAVEK: In or at his home.
3 Not in sex acts though.
4 THE WITNESS: No, not in sex acts.
5 They were conducting surveillance from the
6 outside.
Y
7 A JUROR: I know. Did you do any
P
8 telephone. research or was Oeverything done
C
9 over cell phones?
10 THE WITNESS: DEverything was done
11 over cell phonesE.
I
12 MS. BELOHLAVEK: All right.

25 EXAMINATION
103
1 BY MS. BELOHLAVEK:
2 Q. Okay. Would you introduce yourself to the
3 grand jurors, please?
4 A. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
5 My name is Gregory Parkinson.
6 Q. How -- how long have you been employed as a
Y
7 law enforcement officer?
P
8 A. I have been in business 40O years now. I
C
9 started on October 25th of 1966.
10 Q. And where were you Dworking then?
11 A. I worked for theE West Palm Beach Police
I
12 Department, where I Fserved for 34 years, until I
I
13 retired on July 3rd of the year 2000.
T
14 I had Rthe 4th of July off and went to work
E
15 the next day as an investigator for the State
C
16 Attorney's Office where I worked for 3 years.
A
17 I left on February 14th of 2003, had the
18 Tweekend off, and then took over a management
O
19 position with the Town of Palm Beach Police
N
20 Department, where I am still currently employed.
21 Q. What is your position with Palm Beach
22 Police Department?
23 A. I hold the rank of police officer, but I
24 also hold the title of civilian where I am in
25 charge of the crime scene investigation unit, the
104
1 photography unit, the evidence holding unit, and
2 the fingerprint unit.
3 Q. In your capacity as the crime scene head
4 did you take part in the search warrant executed
5 on Jeffrey Epstein's house on August --
6 October 20, 2005?
Y
7 A. Yes, I did. P
8 Q. Tell us how you go about eOxecuting a search
C
9 warrant in general.
10 A. Once the warrant isD signed and brought back
11 to headquarters, I am n Eot aware of this at that
I
12 time. F
I
13 On this morning, which was a Thursday
T
14 morning, whenR I went to the morning briefing, at
E
15 that time I was informed that a search warrant
C
16 would be executed and that it would be at a
A
17 residence.
18 T My responsibility is to then assemble a
O
19 team of evidence specialists and crime scene
N
20 processors that will respond to this unannounced
21 scene. We don't even know where we're going until
22 we are in a -- what looks like a funeral
23 procession or a parade; all the cars are ready to
24 go. We follow the lead car. And only then, when
25 we arrive, do we know the location.
105
1 Q. Why is that done?
2 A. It's -- it's an issue of security, it's an
3 issue of privacy, and it's an issue of officer
4 safety, so that there is a guarantee that there
5 can be no leak of any information, even as simple
6 as an address, from my office.
Y
7 And we prefer to operate in that manner.
P
8 So we don't know until we get theOre.
C
9 All we really need to know is what are we
10 going to be going into, soD that we know the volume
11 of bags, the volume of Eboxes, the volume of gloves
I
12 or masks or processi F ng gowns or lab coats; whether
I
13 we would need head cover to protect -- or to
T
14 prevent contaRmination of a scene or shoe covers,
15 which will E also prevent contamination of the
C
16 scene.
A
17 We don't need to know a lot about the
18 Tscene, we only need to know what type of evidence
O
19 we're going to be looking for, and the potential
N
20 volume or size of the area.
21 Knowing this, we are then prepared to go to
22 the scene and do whatever's necessary to fulfill
23 the requirements of the search warrant, and that
24 is searching for specific items.
25 Q. Mr. Parkinson, so that would -- in addition
106
1 to officer safety; so that someone's not waiting
2 there to ambush you; also, nobody at the place to
3 be searched knows you're corning so they can just
4 dispose of things?
5 A. That is correct.
6 Q. Okay. On this date, October 20th, where
Y
7 did you go?
P
8 A. I went to a residence locaOted on the island
C
9 of Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida. With
10 an address of 358 El BrillDo.
11 The 300 block isE the block just immediately
I
12 west of the Intraco F astal Waterway.
I
13 Q. East of the Intracoastal Waterway?
T
14 A. It is Ron the east side of the Intracoastal
15 Waterway. E In fact, this particular residence is
C
16 on the Intracoastal Waterway.
A
17 Q. Okay. Describe to us how the house is
18 Tentered?
O
19 A. The residence had staff or personnel
N
20 present at the time of our arrival. Detective
21 Recarey went in ahead of me.
22 And understanding that once you enter the
23 property there is a heightened danger factor with
24 persons or personnel on the scene. And the first
25 thing that must be done, for everyone's safety, is
107
1 to go in and not search for items, but clear the
2 residence of living human beings, so that there
3 can be no access to weapons or any endangerment to
4 them. This was done. And I took part in the
5 search of the second floor on the west end of the
6 residence.
Y
7 All the living persons -- and there were no
P
8 dead persons there -- so all of tOhe persons,
C
9 non-police persons, were escorted out to the south
10 side of the residence intoD a patio area.
11 Q. Were they allowedE to take any items out of
I
12 the home with them? F
I
13 A. No. Nor did the police look, touch, or
T
14 move anythingR; other than opening doors, closets,
15 to make su E re there were no other persons inside.
C
16 It was not a search in the sense of the
A
17 search warrant at this time. It was a search of
18 Tthe residence to clear it and neutralize any
O
19 element of danger.
N
20 This was done. This was accomplished.
21 At this time officer -- Detective Recarey
22 would read out loud, word for word, the search
23 warrant to those persons that were removed from
24 the house.
25 My responsibility at this time was to video
108
1 and audio record the reading of that search
2 warrant to these persons. That I did. And
3 recorded it until the conclusion of the reading of
4 the search warrant .
5 Q. Okay. Were you requested by myself to
6 prepare a diagram of the upper floor of the home
Y
7 searched?
P
8 A. Yes, I was. O
C
9 Q. What rooms are on that upper floor?
10 A. There are several rDooms that are located on
11 the second floor. It iEs basically an L-shaped
I
12 appearance where the F main body of the house is
I
13 aligned east and west. There is an L-shaped short
T
14 leg which proRtrudes to the north. That actually
15 sits -- th E at L-leg sits over a three car garage.
C
16 The second floor contains a on the west
A
17 end, a large master bedroom, which is aligned
18 Tnorth and south. And then off of the south side
O
19 there is a large master bedroom and large closet.
N
20 Coming back through the bedroom to the north side
21 there is another bathroom.
22 And these are quite large bathrooms.
23 They're not like our
24 Q. Okay.
25 A. -- you know, not like my house.
109
1 Q. Is this the diagram you prepared?
2 A. Yes, it is.
3 Q. Okay. Can I ask you to step down and --
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. -- indicate to the grand jurors what the
6 upstairs looks like, what rooms we're seeing here.
Y
7 A. To orient you -- bear in mind P you're
8 looking at the second floor here, O and this is a
C
9 spiral staircase which goes from the second floor
10 down to the first floor. D
11 And this, coinci E dentally, is a double door
I
12 main entrance to theF front of the house. And once
I
13 inside -- oops.
T
14 RA JUROR: Broke the stairway.
E
15 A. I did, I broke the stairway.
C
16 Once entering the front door and coming up
A
17 the stairway you entered a landing. Once inside
18 Tthe landing, it is basically a very long hallway.
O
19 This hallway has a double door set here and a
N
20 double door set here. They open inward on the
21 east side; they open inward on the west side.
22 Once coming through this hallway you then
23 reach a normal size door which gives you access to
24 the master bedroom. Which, this is the master
25 bedroom. This is the large bathroom on the south
110
1 side. And this is the large walk-in closet of
2 which there are two doors that you can enter and
3 walk in all the way through and back out to the
4 other.
5 And, again, moving back through the
6 bedroom, past the hallway you then enter another
Y
7 large bathroom which has a sink, clo P sets, and a
O
8 large bathtub.
C
9 And it was right in here, what looked very
10 similar to a dentist's chaDir, without the big
11 light. It has all kind E s of tubes and things on
I
12 it. I don't know reFally what that thing would do.
I
13 Q. And that wasn't related to the
T
14 investigationR?
E
15 A. No. It was just part of the furniture
C
16 there, like a -- similar to, a bed was here and a
A
17 credenza over here.
18 TQ. Are there toilet facilities here or is it
O
19 just sinks in these bathrooms?
N
20 A. I believe that there were toilets also
21 there in the hall.
22 Q. All right. Did you find a massage table?
23 A. Yes. There was massage table in this
24 clos -- bathroom.
25 Q. Okay. How about massage oils? Were there
111
1 massage oils up in that bathroom?
2 A. I believe there were. I know that we got
3 some kind of a jar of material out of this master
4 bedroom, one of -- out of the dresser.
5 Q. What about out of the actual room where the
6 massage table was?
Y
7 A. That, I'm not sure. P
O
8 I was involved in the actual search and
C
9 photography of that. Other investigators would
10 have to comment on it. D
E
11 Q. Okay. Do you have the reports -
I
12 A. Yes, I do. F
I
13 Q. -- from those investigators?
T
14 A. I -- wRell, I have the evidence sheets --
E
15 Q. Okay.
C
16 A. -- of where things were found.
A
17 Q. Okay. Could you see if there were any
18 Tmassage oils found within the same room where the
O
19 massage table was.
N
20 A. I don't have a listing of that in the
21 packet that I have here.
22 Q. Okay. And items that would be taken into
23 custody by the police department would be itemized
24 on the property receipt like that?
25 A. That's true.
112
1 Q. Okay. But -- and so there was a massage
2 oil found by the master bedroom, this room?
3 A. Yes. And I actually had that pointed out
4 to me by Detective Recarey. And it was called a
5 bottle -- or a Joy Jelly. And it was from the
6 master bedroom on the -- in the credenza which was
Y
7 right here. P
O
8 Q. Okay. You can have a seat again.
C
9 A. Thank you.
10 Q. Thank you. D
E
11 You've had a chance to go over those
I
12 receipts of all the Fproperty that was contained?
I
13 A. Yes.
T
14 Q. Did anRy of the officers find a purple
E
15 vibrator in the home?
C
16 A. I have Item 24, which -- which may be that.
A
17 I have not actually seen it, but it's called a
18 Ttwin torpedo.
O
19 Q. All right. The twin torpedo was not found
N
20 in the master bedroom though, wasn't it found in
21 the other bedroom?
22 I think Detective Recarey testified it was
23 found in Ghislaine Max -- or Nada's bedroom?
24 A. I don't know. I don't have a listing right
25 here on this particular document as to where it
113
1 was found on the evidence sheet. That would be
2 covered in Detective Recarey's report.
3 Q. Nothing listed as a purple vibrator though?
4 A. Not on the sheets that I have.
5 Q. What about a white vibrator?
6 A. I don't remember seeing a white vibrator.
Y
7 That may have been something that was recovered by
P
8 them and photographed by CSI PavOlich.
C
9 Q. But you have the property receipts in this
10 case, and it's not listed?D
11 A. I don't see it lEisted here. No.
I
12 Q. Okay. F
I
13 MS. BELOHLAVEK: At this point I'm
T
14 going Rto see if the grand jurors have any
E
15 further questions for you.
C
16 THE WITNESS: I'm at your service.
A
17 Yes, sir?
18 T A JUROR: Do you have any sexual
O
19 toys, other than the double-headed torpedo
N
20 on your list of --
21 THE WITNESS: Not on the list that I
22 have here, sir.
23 A JUROR: That's the only sexual toy
24 you have?
25 THE WITNESS: Pardon?
114
1 A JUROR: That's the only sexual toy
2 you have that was confiscated in this -
3 search?
4 THE WITNESS: I believe, to my
5 knowledge, it is. I haven't seen the white
6 or purple, so I can't --
Y
7 A JUROR: Or any other P type of sexual
O
8 toy, period.
C
9 THE WITNESS: Right. Personally I
10 have not seen thoseD.
E
11 A JUROR: Okay.
I
12 THE WIFTNESS: But that is not
I
13 uncommon either, because of the nature of
T
14 this iRnvestigation.
E
15 Detective Recarey would be the one
C
16 that has the knowledge on all those
A
17 specific items.
18 T Other than filming the room itself -
O
19 or I'm sorry -- the residence itself prior
N
20 to the search, recording the reading of the
21 search warrant. And then, folks, also
22 after the search I go through and re-video
23 to show that the police did not do any
24 damage. And then the door is finally
25 locked and secured.
115
1 So there would be areas, while I was
2 in it I photographed it from a video
3 standpoint, I would not have direct
4 knowledge of the -- some of the items that
5 were found, but Detective Recarey would.
6 MS. BELOHLAVEK: And you Y obtained
7 copies of all the evidence sh P eets of
O
8 evidence checked in; correct?
C
9 THE WITNESS: As -- I think so. Yes.
10 MS. BELOHLAVEDK: Yes.
E
11 THE WITNESS: Yes.
I
12 MS BELOFHLAVEK: And only that twin
I
13 torpedo T is the only sexual item listed?
14 RTHE WITNESS: As best I can tell you.
E
15 Correct.
C
16 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Okay.
A
17 Yes, sir?
18 T THE WITNESS: Yes, sir?
O
19 A JUROR: Is that report just from
N
20 the master bedroom or from all the bedrooms
21 on the second floor?
22 THE WITNESS: Actually, it represents
23 the entire residence, plus the two -- the
24 servants quarters, barracks; and on the
25 southwest corner, the fitness and exercise
116
1 room. I believe this encompasses
2 A JUROR: Can you --
3 THE WITNESS: -- everything.
4 A JUROR: Can you point out on that
5 what the room was that this woman Nadia
6 was in?
Y
7 MS . BELOHLAVEK: Are yo P u familiar
8 with which bedroom was NaOdia's?
C
9 THE WITNESS: I am not.
10 MS. BELOHLAVEDK: Detective Carey --
11 Recarey, we can
E--
I
12 THE WIFTNESS: Right.
I
13 MS. BELOHLAVEK: -- bring him back to
T
14 show tRhat. Okay.
E
15 THE WITNESS: Right.
C
16 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Any other questions?
A
17 Yes, sir. In the back.
18 T A JUROR: Was the suspect at the
O
19 house at the time that you served the
N
20 warrant, sir?
21 THE WITNESS: No, sir. He was not.
22 A JUROR: Thank you.
23 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, sir?
24 A JUROR: Do your warrants have
25 anything listed for like computer equipment
117
1 or things like that or is it
2 THE WITNESS: It did.
3 A JUROR: It did?
4 THE WITNESS: Yes.
5 And we did take computer equipment.
6 A JUROR: And is -- can you say
Y
7 what's on it or P
O
8 THE WITNESS: That was handled by the
C
9 special investigations unit.
10 And while I Dsaw -- actually
E
11 physically saw the computers, and saw them
I
12 disconnected Fand removed, I never saw
I
13 anything that was on those computers.
T
14 RA JUROR: And did they confiscate
E
15 passports or anything from anyone in the
C
16 home or --
A
17 THE WITNESS: No, sir. Not
18 T passports .
O
19 And there were weapons in the house,
N
20 rifles --
21 A JUROR: And they left them.
22 THE WITNESS: -- that -- yes, sir.
23 They were left behind because that
24 was never part of what we were looking for,
25 so those were all left behind.
118
1 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, sir?
2 THE WITNESS: Yes, sir?
3 A JUROR: Could you tell us, the
4 people that that you found there, who
5 they were?
6 THE WITNESS: Do I know w Y ho they
7 were? P
O
8 A JUROR: The people -- yeah. Who
C
9 they were.
10 THE WITNESS: DI understand one was
E
11 the property management -- manager. I
I
12 think he was Feither Germanic or possibly
I
13 Polish, h T e has an Eastern European accent .
14 RA JUROR: That was the only person?
E
15 THE WITNESS: No. There were, I
C
16 think, three other people.
A
17 A JUROR: Who were they?
18 T THE WITNESS: I don't know who they
O
19 were, sir.
N
20 MS. BELOHLAVEK: We can ask Detective
21 Recarey.
22 THE WITNESS: Right. Detective
23 Recarey would know who they were.
24 A JUROR: Do you know that the
25 gentlemen that owned the house was out
119
1 did they tell you he was out of town?
2 THE WITNESS: Yes. We knew he was
3 out of town. Yes.
4 MS. BELOHLAVEK: All right. Thank
5 you.

I
13 A JUROR: Do you think he took
T
14 advantRage of your youth?
E
15 THE WITNESS: Maybe.
C
16 But it was also stupid of me to put
A
17 myself in that situation.
18 T A JUROR: Perhaps you were too young
O
19 to be up against a man of that age who had

O
8 I was successful until about 2 days ago.
C
9 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, ma'am?
10 A JUROR: Yes D . So the reason that
E
11 you don't want to testify is more just
I
12 because of pFersonal embarrassment?
I
13 THE T WITNESS: Yes.
14 R A JUROR: Okay.
E
15 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, sir?
C
16 A JUROR: Jeffrey knew or you had

N
20 A JUROR: And he was aware of that?

25 would you want her to testify or tell you?
139
1 THE WITNESS: I don't really know.
2 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, ma'am?
3 A JUROR: Would it mean anything
4 special to you if you could be the person
5 that's strong enough to stand up to put him
6 away so he will never ever do th Y is to
7 somebody else? P
O
8 Could you be strong enough to do that
C
9 or want to do that?
10 THE WITNESS: DI wish that I could say

11 that I could, but I really don't think that
I
12 I can. F

E
15 A JUROR: Yeah.
C
16 MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes.

18 T about testifying, would you do it I
O
19 mean, would you testify if you were
N
20 subpoenaed, and would you tell the truth?
21 THE WITNESS: If I did not have a
22 choice whether or not to testify, obviously
23 I would have to.
24 Yes, I would tell the truth, because
25 if I'm going to have to do it, I might as
140
1 well do it right.
2 A JUROR: I think, for your
3 character -- for your own well-being
4 MS. BELOHLAVEK: You have to ask
5 questions, not comment.
6 A JUROR: Okay. To testif Y y would be
7 the right thing to do and theP legal thing
O
8 to do.
C
9 A JUROR: Is that a question?
10 MS. BELOHLAVE D K: We need a question.
E
11 A JUROR: Would you do it under those
I
12 circumstancesF?
I
13 THET WITNESS: Like I said, if it was
14 betwee R n testifying and going to jail, I
E
15 would testify. Which is why I'm here
