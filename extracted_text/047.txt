Re: Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as
executors of the Estate of Jefferey E. Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell,
No. 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:
We represent Defendants Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, as Co-Executors
of the Estate of Jefferey E. Epstein (the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action.
Together with counsel for Plaintiff and pursuant to this Court’s Order dated April 1, 2020
(ECF Doc. 35), we submit this joint status report regarding discovery and settlement
discussions.
I. Discovery
On April 20, 2020, the parties served their initial interrogatories and requests for
production on each other. The parties served their responses and objections on June 3,
2020. The parties are working to set deposition dates, with Darren Indyke's deposition
already scheduled for August 7, 2020. The parties are also corresponding to resolve
any discovery disputes.
II. Settlement Discussions
As the Co-Executors recently advised the Court in another action, the Epstein
Victims’ Compensation Program (“Program”) has been established, with formal claims
accepted for the Program Administrator’s review starting on June 25, 2020. The Co-
Executors encourage Plaintiff to consider participating in the Program.
Plaintiff is currently considering whether or not she will be participating in the Program.
