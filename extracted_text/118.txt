Dear Judge Koeltl:
Plaintiff Jane Doe hereby responds to the letter submitted by Ms. Maxwell's defense
counsel on November 22, 2021 seeking authorization from this Court to disclose an unredacted
copy of the settlement release as part of Ms. Maxwell's criminal defense. As this Court
previously stated in its Memorandum Opinion and Order (ECF No. 32), "the plaintiff has an
understandable interest in maintaining her anonymity, and the Court entered an order to protect
it." As a condition of the dismissal of this action, Plaintiff produced to Ms. Maxwell an
authentic, unredacted and signed copy of the settlement release. Plaintiffs anonymity, however,
would be severely compromised if an unredacted copy of the release were to be used by Ms.
Maxwell "as part of her criminal defense." Indeed, nowhere in Ms. Maxwell's letter does she
actually state how the unredacted release would be used in her criminal case or which witnesses
or persons she would show it to. Accordingly, and contrary to this Court's previous ruling, there
is no way of knowing that the unredacted copy of the release will be "used only for a proper
purpose." (Id. at 6). Plaintiff is also unaware of what protections are in place, if any, in the
criminal case that would maintain her anonymity in the event that an unredacted copy of the
release was to be used in some way by Ms. Maxwell.
Further, it is Plaintiffs understanding that Ms. Maxwell's Rule 17(c ) subpoena issued to
the EVCP for the settlement release has been granted by Judge Nathan. Accordingly, the matter
currently before this Court is moot.
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny Ms. Maxwell's
request allowing her to disclose a copy of the unredacted release.
