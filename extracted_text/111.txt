AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S
APPLICATION FOR COSTS AGAINST PLAINTIFF
I, Laura A. Menninger, declare pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 and under penalty of perjury
that:
1. I am counsel for defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell in Doe v. Indyke, et al., No. 20-CV-
00484-JGK (S.D.N.Y.). I am personally familiar with the costs incurred in connection with the
litigation.
2. I am submitting this Declaration in support of Ghislaine Maxwell’s Bill of Costs and
application for an award of costs against Jane Doe ("Plaintiff") in this action.
3. On January 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice Pursuant to
FRCP 41(a)(2). Dkt. 91. Ms. Maxwell responded on January 29 (Dkt. 93), and further litigation
regarding the dismissal occurred over the succeeding months.

4. On March 8, 2021, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order which
determined, inter alia, that granted the dismissal with prejudice subject to certain conditions.
Dkt. 98. Among the conditions were that Ms. Maxwell is permitted to seek her costs related to
this action from Plaintiff. Id. at 7. The parties accepted the Court's conditions and on March 19,
this Court issued an Order dismissing the case and ordering the conditions. Dkt. 102.
5. This Court determined that Ms. Maxwell is the "prevailing party for the purposes of
Rule 54(d). Dkt. 98 at 5. Accordingly she is entitled "under Rule 54(d), [to] 'costs-other than
attorney's fees." Id. (quoting Rule 54(d)).
6. Because discovery was stayed in the case by Magistrate Judge Freeman, the costs
were in fact de minimis. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell exercises her right to recovery of those
costs pursuant to Rule 54(d).
7. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1923, Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Docket Fees for
discontinuance of a civil action in the amount of $5.
8. Additionally, Ms. Maxwell incurred $8.70 in search and printing costs from PACER
associated with this case.
9. The total costs sought by Ms. Maxwell therefore is $13.70.
10. The Bill of Costs attached to the Notice and its exhibits evidence the costs incurred
by Ms. Maxwell in defense of this action.
11. Each of the costs claimed are allowed by law, specifically Local Civil Rule 54.1.
Each are correctly stated and were necessarily incurred.
I swear under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and accurate to the best of my
knowledge.
