Dear Judge Koeltl:
We represent Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E.
Epstein (together, the “Co-Executors”), in the above-referenced action. We write to respectfully
request the Court’s approval of the parties’ agreement described below.
On January 22, 2020, subject to the Court’s approval: (1) we agreed to accept service of
Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF #9) on the Co-Executors’ behalf; (2) Plaintiff consented to the Co-
Executors having through Monday, March 23, 2020 to answer, move or otherwise respond to
Plaintiff’s Complaint and Motion to Proceed by Pseudonym (ECF #5); and (3) the parties agreed
to adjourn the initial case conference in this matter to a mutually agreeable time after the Co-
Executors’ deadline to respond to the Complaint. There have been no previous requests for
adjournments or extensions of time in this action.
Respectfully submitted,
